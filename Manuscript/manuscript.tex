\section{Introduction}

In NMRlipids I and II project we were looking for a MD model
which would correctly reproduce headgroup and glycerol
backbone structures and cation binding for PC lipid bilayers \cite{botan15,catte16}.
Here we extend the same goal for other than PC lipids.
Currently the focus is on PE, PG and PS bilayers and their
mixtures with PC. Experimental data with different amounts of 
added salt is now collected and presented in this manuscript.
Simulations for bilayers containing PG and PS with low salt conditions
are ran with parameters from CHARMM GUI
and compared to experiments. Some order parameters from
simulations seems to be off from experimental values.
Simulation data from other models would be highly useful 
to see if some of the existing models would reproduce the 
experimental order parameters and to analyze different 
conformations predicted by different models respect to 
experiments.

%Phospholipids containing various polar headgroups and acyl
%chains are essential building blocks of biological membranes.
%Atomistic level structural details of lipids and lipid-ion 
%interactions are considered highly important in several
%biological processes. The lipid structure and ion binding
%can be studied in detail with NMR spectroscopy. However,
%the structural interpretation of NMR data requires usage
%of models. The combination of classical molecular dynamics
%simulations with NMR data, especially with C-H bond
%order parameters, can potentially give atomistic resolution
%interpretation of structure and dynamics of molecules \cite{botan15,ollila16,ferreira16}. 

%Our recent studies concluded that MD models are cabable to
%give structural interpretation for phosphatidylcholine 
%hydrophopic acyl chain region, while hydrophilic headgrop, glycerol 
%backbone and cation binding posed a major challenge for current
%force fields \cite{botan15,ollila16,catte16,ferreira16}. 
%These conclusions were reached by reviewing extensively 
%available experimental data from various sources and using
%NMRlipids Open Collaboration project to collect massive 
%amount of simulation data \cite{botan15,catte16}.

%Here we apply the same approach in search of MD simulation
%models which would reproduce glycerol backbone and 
%headgroup structures of lipids with PE, PG and PS headgroups.  
%In addition, we attempt to find a MD simulation model
%that would be able to correctly describe cation binding in
%bilayer containing negatively charged PG and PS lipids.


%Several MD simulation models have succesfully described 
%acyl chain structures and their qaulitative changes in different
%conditions for phosphatidylcholine lipids (for review see \cite{ollila16}).
%However, the current simulation models were not found to be accurate
%enough for full structural interpretation of phosphatidylcholine headgroup and
%glycerol backbone \cite{botan15}. Also Na$ +$  binding affinities
%were found to be significantly overestimated in several models and 
%none of the available models was able to Ca$2+$

\section{Experimental glycerol backbone and headgroup order parameters for PE, PG and PS lipids}

Absolute values of experimental order parameters for different lipid headgroups are
collected in Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}. Signs are measured only for PC as far as I know,
thus only absolute values are used for now.
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Figs/HGorderparameters.eps}
  \caption{\label{HGorderParameters}
    Absolute values of order parameters for headgroup and glycerol backbone with different headgroups
    from experiments. POPC values are from \cite{ferreira13}, DOPS from \cite{browning80} contains 0.1M of NaCl,
    POPG from \cite{borle85} contains 10nM PIPES, DPPG from \cite{wohlgemuth80} contains  10mM PIPES and 100mM NaCl,
    DPPE from \cite{seelig76}, E.coliPE and E.coliPG are from \cite{gally81}.
  }
\end{figure}

Based on superficial reading, the conclusions in the literature are roughly \\ 
1) glycerol backbone structures are largely similar irrespectively of the headroup \cite{gally81}, \\
2) glycerol backbone and headgroup structure and behaviour are similar in model membranes and in bacteria \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90}, \\
3) headgroup structures are similar in PC, PE and PG lipids, while headgroup is more rigid in PS lipids \cite{wohlgemuth80,buldt81}. \\
Extensive discussion about structural details of PE, PG or PS headgroups do not exists (as far as I know), 
In contrast to PC lipids (see \cite{botan15} and references therein).


\section{Glycerol backbone and headgroup order parameters for PE, PG and PS lipids in simulations}

Several simulations containing PE, PG and PS lipids have been published \cite{??}, \todo{List should be completed}
however, glycerol backbone and headgroup order parameters are not compared to
the experiments (based on superficial reading of literature).

Comparison between experiments and simulations with CHARMM GUI
parameters for PS lipids in Fig. \ref{HGorderParametersPOPS} suggest that
the model overestimates magnitudes in $\beta$ and g$_3$ order parameters
and forking in $\alpha$.

  \todo{Experimental signs of the order parameters would highly useful.} \\
  \todo{Why there is difference between CHARMM36 simulation results from POPS:POPC mixture and
  pure POPS?}
\end{figure}

Comparison between experiments and simulations with CHARMM GUI
parameters for PG lipids in Fig. \ref{HGorderParametersPOPG} suggest that
the model overestimates forking in $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ order parameters,
and magnitudes of $\beta$ and $g_1$ order parameters.

\section{Ca$^{2+}$ binding in bilayers with negatively charged PG and PS lipids}

PC lipid headgroup order parameters can used to measure ion binding
affinity, because their magnitude is linearly proportional
to the amount of bound charge in bilayer \cite{seelig87,catte16}.
This molecular electrometer concept can be used also
for bilayers containing PC lipids mixed with charged lipids \cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux90}.
This is demonstrated in Figs \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl},
\ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M} and \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M},
showing order parameters for PC headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons
as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration in the presence of different amounts of
negatively charged PS or PG lipids.
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Figs/LIPIDSwithCaCl.eps}
  \caption{\label{OrderParametersWithCaCl}
    PC headgroup order parameters as a function of CaCl concentration from experiments containing charged lipids.

    and POPC:POPG mixture data without NaCl from \cite{borle85}.
  }
  \todo{Check the NaCl concentrations in the samples.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Figs/LIPIDSwithCaClBELOW1M.eps}
  \caption{\label{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M}
    Figure \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl} zoomed to smaller concentrations.
  }
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Figs/CHANGESwithCaCl.eps}
  \caption{\label{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}
    The change of PC headgroup order parameters
    in the presence of different amount of negatively charged lipids
    respect to the values without added CaCl$_2$.
    The original data is the same as in Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl}. 
  }
\end{figure}

PC headgroup order parameters increase when negatively charged
PS or PG are added to PC bilayer in the absense of added CaCl$_2$,
as expected based on electrometer concept \cite{seelig87}
(see Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%In electrometer concept this is explained by the tilting of
%headgroup more parallel to membrane normal \cite{??}.
Further, the order parameters decrease with the addition
of CaCl$_2$ and the decrease is more pronounced for systems with more
negatively charged lipids (see Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}).
At CaCl$_2$ concentrations ($\sim$ 50-300mM) where order parameters reach the values for pure PC,
the Ca2+ binding presumably fully cancels the charge from negative lipids and
overcharging occurs above these concenterations.
The interpretation of this data and some other results has been that \cite{seelig90}
\begin{displayquote}
  {\it ''(i) Ca$^{2+}$ binds to neutral lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine) and negatively charged lipids
    (phosphatidylglycerol) with approximately the same binding constant of K = 10-20 M$^{-1}$; \\
    (ii) the free Ca$^{2+}$
    concentration at the membrane interface is distinctly enhanced if the membrane carries a negative surface
    charge, either due to protein or to lipid; \\
    (iii) increased inter-facial Ca$^{2+}$ also means increased amounts
    of bound Ca$^{2+}$ at neutral and charged lipids; \\
    (iv) the actual binding step can be described by a Langmuir
    adsorption isotherm with a 1 lipid:1 Ca$^{2+}$ stoichiometry, provided the interfacial concentration C$_M$, is
    used to describe the chemical binding equilibrium.''}
\end{displayquote}

Also the experimental order parameters for PS and PG headgroups
as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration are shown in Fig. \ref{PSPGchangesWITHCaCl}.
\todo{These should be compared to simulations for potential structural interpretation of the changes.}
