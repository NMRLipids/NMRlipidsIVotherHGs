Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most common negatively
charged lipid in eykaryotic membranes.
PS lipids interact with signaling and other proteins via
electrostatic interactions and direct binding, and induce
membrane fusion and phase separation together with calcium ions.
Molecular details of these phenomena are not well understood
because accurate models to interpret the experimental data has not
been available. Here, we collect a set of experimental NMR data which
can be used together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
to interpret the lipid headgroup structures and details of ion binding
in pure PS and mixed PS:PC lipid bilayers. We use the open collaboration
method to collect data from available MD simulation models of PS lipids.
None of the models reproduce the NMR data with experimental accuracy,
but the best models suggest that the carboxyl group in the serine headgroup
does not rotate freely. In line with the previous results for PC lipids,
none of the tested force fields correctly captures the cation binding affinity to lipid bilayers containing
PS lipids. In contrast to PC lipids, the response of PS headgroups
to the bound ions qualitatively differs from experiments in the tested MD
simulation models. The collected experimental dataset and simulation
results pave the way for improvement of lipid force fields to correctly
describe negatively charged membranes and their interactions with ions.
The work is performed in the NMRlipids open collaboration project (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}).

\section{Introduction}
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most common negatively
charged lipid in eykaryotic membranes.
PS lipids compose 8.5\% of total lipid weight of erythrocytes,
but the abundance varies between different organelles up to
25-35\% in plasma membrane \cite{lemmon08,leventis10,li14}.
Despite of the relatively low abundance, PS lipids
are important signaling molecules. They interact with
signaling proteins \cite{leventis10}, regulate
surface charge and protein localization \cite{yeung08}, and
induce protein aggregation \cite{zhao04,gorbenko06}.
Some protein domains spesifically interact PS lipids,
while others are attracted by general electrostatics and the
binding can be regulated by calcium \cite{leventis10}.
Therefore, the structural details
of lipid headgroups and the details of cation binding
are crucial for the PS mediated signaling processes.

Previous experimental studies have concluded that
PS headgroups are more rigid than phophocholines (PC)
due to the hydrogen bonding network or
electrostatic interactions \cite{browning80,buldt81}.
Multivalent cations and Li$^+$ are able to form strong
dehydrated molecular complexes with PS lipids,
while monovalent ions interact more weakly with PS
containing bilayers \cite{hauser77,kurland79,eisenberg79,hauser83,dluhy83,hauser85,feigenson86,mattai89,roux90,roux91,boettcher11}.
The dehydrated complexes of PS headgroup and calcium ions can also lead to the
phase separation \cite{hauser77,kurland79,hauser85,feigenson86,mattai89,roux90,roux91}.
On the other hand, some studies propose that the specific binding
affinity is similar to the negatively charged and zwitterionic lipids and that
the increased cation binding to negatively charged lipid bilayer arise only due
to the increase of local cation concentration in the vicinity of membranes \cite{seelig90,sinn06}.
Dilution of bilayers with PC lipids makes PS headgroups
less rigid and reduces propensity for the formation of
strong complexes with multivalent ions \cite{browning80,buldt81,roux90,roux91}.
The molecular level interpretation of these observations is,
however, not available.

Several classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies are done
to understand PS headgroups, their influence on lipid bilayer properties and
interactions with
ions \cite{cascales96,pandit02,mukhopadhyay04,pedersen06,vernier09,boettcher11,molina12,jurkiewicz12,venable13,pan14,vangaveti14,melcrova16,valentine18,hallock18}.
However, the results strongly depend on the used force field parameters.
For example, the recent simulations using NBfix parameters for calcium \cite{kim16} in
CHARMM36 force field \cite{klauda10,venable13} combined with 2D infrared spectroscopy
suggests that calcium ions interacts only with the carboxylate group of PS lipids \cite{valentine18}, while
the same force field without the NBfix parameters together with the NMR chemical shifts and
REDOR experiments suggests a significant binding affinity also to the phosphate region \cite{hallock18}.
On the other hand, simulations with the Berger force field \cite{berger97,mukhopadhyay04}
combined with fluorescent and vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy suggested a significant
calcium binding also to the carbonyls in the acyl chains \cite{melcrova16}. 
We have recently demonstrated that such controversies can be resolved by
comparing C-H bond order parameters of lipid headgroups between simulations
and experiments \cite{botan15,catte16}, which can be directly
measured from NMR experiments with high accuracy and compared to simulations
in order to evaluate the simulation model quality or to interpret the experiments \cite{ollila16}.
Previous studies showed that the structure of PC lipid headgroup and glycerol backbone are not well
captured by most simulation models \cite{botan15} and that the cation binding to PC
lipid bilayers is overestimated \cite{catte16}. Based on this data, the cation binding
affinity to POPC bilayer was then improved by implicitly including the electronic polarizability
using the electronic continuum correction \cite{melcr18}.

Here, we collect the set of experimentally measured lipid headgroup and
glycerol backbone C-H bond order parameters, which can be used to
evaluate the quality of headgroup structure and the ion binding affinity
in MD simulations of lipid bilayers containing PS lipids. 
The available MD simulation models of PS are then compared with
the collected experimental data using the NMRlipids open collaboration
project (\url{www.nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}). The results pave the way
for the development of lipid force fields with realistic description of
the headgroup region of negatively charged lipids in physiological salt
conditions. Such models are expected to be useful in understanding
biological function of lipid headgroups and glycerol backbone because
they behave similarly in model membranes and in bacterial cells \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90}.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{C-H bond order parameters from the natural abundance $^{13}$C NMR}

Headgroup and glycerol backbone C-H bond order parameters of POPS
were determined from the chemical-shift resolved dipolar splittings
measured with a R-type Proton Detected Local Field (R-PDFL) experiment~\cite{dvinskikh04}.
The corresponding order parameter signs were measured with a S-DROSS experiment~\cite{gross97}
using natural abundance $^{13}$C solid state NMR spectroscopy as described previously \cite{ferreira13,ferreira16}.
The experiments were done in a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer operating at a $^1$H Larmor frequency of 400.03 MHz.
Magic angle spinning (MAS) of the sample was used at a frequency of 5.15 kHz (R-PDLF experiment) and 5 kHz (S-DROSS experiment).
The following experimental setups were used.

{\emph{C-H bond order parameters from the R-PDLF experiment}}. The parameters are described according to Figures 1c and 2c of the original reference
for the R-PDLF experiment~\cite{dvinskikh04}.  The refocused-INEPT delays $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ were 1.94 ms and 0.97 ms, respectively.
Radio frequency pulses with the nutation frequencies: 46.35 kHz (R18$^7_1$ pulses), 63.45 kHz ($^{13}$C 90$^{\rm{o}}$ and 180$^{\rm{o}}$),
50 kHz (SPINAL64 $^1$H decoupling pulses). The $t_1$ increment was equal to 10.79 $\mu$s $\times18\times2$ and 32 points in the indirect
dimension were recorded using 1024 scans for each, with recycle delay of 5 s and a spectral with of 149.5 ppm.

\emph{Order parameter signs from the S-DROSS experiment}.
The parameters are described according to Figures 1b and 1c of the original reference for the S-DROSS
experiment~\cite{gross97}. The refocused-INEPT delay $\delta_2$ was 1.19 ms. The $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ in the S-DROSS recoupling
blocks $R$ were set as 39.4 $\mu$s and 89.4 $\mu$s, respectively. Radio frequency pulses with the nutation
frequencies: 63.45 kHz ($^{13}$C 90$^{\rm{o}}$ and 180$^{\rm{o}}$), 50 kHz ($^1$H SPINAL64 decoupling).
The $t_1$ increment (dipolar recoupling dimension) was 800 $\mu$s and a total of 8 points along $t_1$ were
measured using 1024 scans for each with a recycle delay of 5 s and a spectral with of 149.5 ppm.

\emph{Numerical simulations of S-DROSS curves.}
The numerical simulations of S-DROSS curves were performed with the SIMPSON simulation package \cite{bak00} using the $^{13}$C--$^1$H
dipolar couplings determined by the R-PDLF experiments or calculated from the known $^2$H quadrupolar couplings \cite{browning80} as input.
The chemical shift anisotropy and homonuclear couplings were neglected, and the input file {\it{rep2000}} was used to simulate the random
distribution of bilayer orientations in the samples studied.

\emph{Sample preparation}
The sample was prepared simply by mixing the POPS with water (lipid:water 60:40 wt\%) in an eppendorf
tube mixing and centrifuging the sample repeatedly until an homogeneous viscous fluid was obtained.
20 mg of sample was then transferred to an NMR insert suitable for 4 mm NMR rotors.  
\todo{Maybe we need little bit more information about the mixing procedure?} 


\subsection{Molecular dynamics simulations}
Molecular dynamics simulation data was collected using
the Open Collaboration method \cite{botan15}.
The NMRlipids project blog (\url{www.nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}) and
the GitHub repository (\url{www.github.com/NMRLipids/NMRlipidsIVotherHGs})
were used as the communication platforms.
The simulated systems are listed in 
Tables \ref{PSsystems} (pure PS systems without additional ions) 
and \ref{mixedIONsystems} (mixed PC:PS systems with various ions concentrations).
Further simulation details are given in the SI.
The simulation data is also indexed in the
searchable database (\url{www.nmrlipids.fi}),
and in the NMRlipids/MATCH GitHub repository (\url{https://github.com/NMRLipids/MATCH}).

The C-H bond order parameters were calculated directly
from the definition
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3\cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the C-H bond and the membrane normal.
Angular brackets point to the average over all sampled configurations.
The order parameters were first calculated averaging over time separately
for each lipid molecule in the system. The average and
the standard error of the mean were then calculated over different lipids.
The python program ({\it scripts/calcOrderParameters.py}) utilizing
MDAnalysis library \cite{agrawal11,gowers16} is available in Ref. \citenum{MATCHgit}. 
The number density profiles were calculated using {\it gmx density} tool
from Gromacs sofware package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}.

\subsection{Comparison of ion binding to negatively charged lipid bilayers 
between simulations and experiments using the electrometer concept}

The order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in PC lipids
can be used to measure the ion binding affinity because they 
decrease proportionally to the amound of bound positive
charge to a bilayer \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87}.
This molecular electrometer concept is especially useful for 
the comparison between simulations and experiments because
the headgroup order parameters can be directly calculated from 
simulations and compared to the experimental data with varying cation
concentrations~\cite{catte16}. The headgroup order parameters
of negatively charged PS and PG lipids exhibit systemic, but less
characterized dependence on the bound charge~\cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux86,roux90}.
Therefore, the ion binding affinity to negatively charged bilayers
can be better characterized by measuring the PC headgroup order parameters from 
mixed bilayers~\cite{roux86,roux90,roux91}, see section \ref{electrometerFORmixtures} in the supplementary information.

Before using the PC headgroup order parameters to quantify the ion binding
affinity, it is important to quantify their response to the known amount of bound charge~\cite{catte16,melcr18}.
This can be done using the experimental data from the mixtures of
monovalent cationic surfactants (dihexadecyldimethylammonium) and POPC~\cite{scherer89,melcr18},
see section \ref{electrometerCALIBRATION} in the supplementary information.
In this work, we also quantify the response of PC headgroup order parameters
to the negatively charged PS headgroups, which also follows the electrometer
concept in the experiments~\cite{scherer87},
see section \ref{electrometerFORmixtures} in the supplementary information.

In the experimental $^2$H NMR literature data used in this work~\cite{browning80,roux90},
the lipids were first soluted to the buffer and then centrifuged to a pellet which
was used in the measurements. Such samples have lower lipid concentration
(approximately 10~wt~\% of lipids~\cite{browning80,roux88,roux90}) than 
gravimetric samples (60~wt~\%) and simulations (approximately 50-60~wt~\%) in this work.
Larger multilamellar repeat distances are expected in the samples with lower lipid
concentrations due to the swelling caused by electrostatic repulsion in pure PS lipid systems~\cite{millman82}.
However, the PS headgroup order parameters measured from gravimetric sample in this work
are in good agreement with the results from centrifuged sample in the literature \cite{browning80} (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}).
Furthermore, the equlibrium repeat distance rapidly decreases with the addtion of monovalent
salts and is close to the simulation box sizes already above 500~mM concentrations~\cite{millman82,rand89}.
Therefore, the hydration levels of multilamellae are expected to be sufficiently similar
in the used simulations and reference experiments.

Two different definitions for the salt concentrations have been used when
electrometer concept is applied to study ion binding affinity.
The concentrations are reported either in water before solvating the lipids \cite{akutsu81,roux90,catte16}
or in bulk water after solvating the lipids \cite{altenbach84,melcr18}.
In this work, we use the former definition to be consistent with the reference
experimental data \cite{roux90}. The used definition has only a marginal effect
to the results is simulations with realistic ion binding affinity
(section \ref{concentrationDEFsection} in the supplementary information).

    are measured in this work. Signs of the PC order parameters are measured previously~\cite{ferreira16}.
  }
\end{figure}

The INEPT and 2D R-PDLF experiments from POPS sample give well resolved spectras for all the
carbons in headgroup and glycerol backbone region (Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson}).
The glycerol backbone carbon peaks were assigned according to the POPC spectra~\cite{ferreira13}.
The peaks for $\beta$ and $\alpha$ carbons were assigned according to the
known order parameters from the $^2$H NMR experiments~\cite{browning80}.
Slices of the R-PDFL spectra and the resulting order parameters values
are shown in the supplementary information (Fig. \ref{DPslices}). 
Since the R-PDFL and previous $^2$H NMR experiments \cite{browning80,roux91} give 
only the absolute values of order parameters, we determined the signs of PS headgroup
order parameters using the S-DROSS experiment \cite{gross97}.
The S-DROSS slice clearly shows that the order parameter of
the $\beta$-carbon is negative (Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson} C)),
which is confirmed by SIMPSON simulations. The beginning of the S-DROSS slice
suggests that the larger order parameter of the $\alpha$-carbon 
is positive and the deviation towards negative values with longer T$_1$ times suggests
that the smaller order parameter is negative. This is confirmed by a SIMPSON simulation
using the value of -0.02 from $^2$H NMR experiment \cite{roux91} for the smaller order parameter.
The literature value was used because the
resolution of our experiment was not sufficient to determine the
small value of the order parameter.
The S-DROSS curve from SIMPSON simulation with a positive value for the smaller order parameter
(dashed grey in Fig. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson} C)) did not agree with the experiment, 
confirming the interpretation that the smaller order parameter is negative.

    Light blue areas span 0.04 units around the average of the extremal experimental values,
    which is the expected quantitative accuracy of experimental values~\cite{ollila16}.
    The vertical bars shown for some simulation values

    we had at least two data sets; the ends of the bars mark the extreme values
    from the sets, and the dot marks their measurement-time-weighted average.
  }
\end{figure}


The headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of 
POPS measured in this work are in good agreement with the previously reported
values from $^2$H NMR experiments of DOPS \cite{browning80} (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}).
When compared with the previously measured values for POPC \cite{ferreira13} (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}),
the $\beta$-carbon order parameter is significantly more negative and $\alpha$-carbon
experiences a significant forking (different order parameters for two hydrogens in the same carbon \cite{ollila16}) in the PS headgroup.
These features have been intepreted to arise from a rigid PS headgroup
conformation, stabilized by hydrogen bonds or electrostatic
interactions \cite{browning80,buldt81}, but detailed structrural interpretation is not
available.

\end{figure}

The headgroup and glycerol backbone of PS lipids show wide variety in the order parameters and structures
between different simulation models (Figs. \ref{HGorderParametersPS} and \ref{HGandGLYstructuresPS}),
as previously observed also for PC lipids \cite{botan15}.
The models perform generally less well for PS lipids than for PC lipids 
(Figs.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS} and \ref{comparisonTablePS} vs. Figs. 2 and 4 in Ref.~\cite{botan15}).
Therefore, the interpretation of structural differences between PC and PS headgroups
from simulations is not straightforward.

  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Figs/NAdensPOPS.eps}
  \caption{\label{NAdensPOPS}
    Counterion densities of POPS lipid bilayer along the membrane normal from

  }
\end{figure}



However, the best performing models,
Slipids, CHARMM36 and CHARMM36ua, reproduce the larger forking of the $\alpha$-carbon 
and the Slipids model reproduces also the lower of the $\beta$-carbon order parameter
when comparing the PS results to PC (Fig. \ref{HGorderParametersPS} vs. Fig. 2 in Ref.~\citenum{botan15}).
Interestingly, the C$_\alpha$-C$_\beta$-C$_\gamma$-O$_\gamma$  dihedral with
a single and narrow peak in the angle distribution close to 120$^{\circ}$ is more restricted
in the best three models than in other models which give two maxima with different angles (Fig. \ref{dihedralsHG}).
The restricted motion is also
visible in the sampled conformations (Figs.~\ref{HGstructuresPSandPC} (A) and \ref{HGandGLYstructuresPS})
suggesting that the rotation of carboxyl group is limited in the serine headgroup.
In addition, the N-C$_\beta$-C$_\alpha$-O$_\alpha$ dihedral exhibit a more asymmetric
and restricted angle distribution for PS than for PC headgroup in
CHARMM36 simulations in best agreement with experiments
(Figs.~\ref{HGstructuresPSandPC} (B) and \ref{dihedralsHGpc}).
The results might manifest the increased rigidity anticipated in the early experimental studies \cite{browning80,buldt81}.
Also, the sampled conformations of glycerol backbone
significantly vary between different simulation models 
(Figs. \ref{dihedralsGLY}, \ref{HGandGLYstructuresPS}, \ref{dihedralsGLYpc} and \ref{HGandGLYstructuresPSPC}),
but further analysis is beyond the scope of this work which the PS headgroup.

The suggested characteristic conformations of PS headgroup may be useful when interpreting experiments and
can guide the further force field development. However, more accurate simulations are
required to confirm the suggested conformations because the simulated PS headgroup order parameters
are not within the experimental error bars in any of the tested models.

\end{figure}


Membranes containing PS lipids are always accomppanied with counterions which
modulate electrostatic interactions between lipids and other biomolecules. 
Counterions are also suggested to screen the repulsion between charged lipid headgroups 
in MD simulations and reduce the area per lipid of PS bilayers to be smaller than in PC
bilayers~\cite{pandit02,mukhopadhyay04,pedersen06}. 
The counterion density profiles along membrane normal 
show significant differences between simulation models in both binding affinity
and distribution of ions in the interface (Fig. \ref{NAdensPOPS}).
The experimental area per lipid (62.7 $\AA^2$) \cite{pan14} 
is reproduced only in Gromos-CKP simulations and in the MacRog simulation
with potassium counterions, while other models give significantly lower values (Fig. \ref{NAdensPOPS}).
The counterion binding and concomintant electrostatic screening of the headgroup
repulsion does not fully explain the low area per molecule values
because the MacRog simulation with strongest sodium binding
(the lowest concentrations in bulk water) gives the same area per molecule
as CHARMM36ua simulation with significantly weaker counterion binding
affinity. On the other hand, changing counterions from sodium to potassium, having weaker binding
affinity, increases the area per molecule from 53 $\AA^2$ to 63 $\AA^2$ in MacRog simulations.
In conclusion, the results are in line with the previous study suggesting that the
low area per molecule in PS lipid bilayers originate from the combination
of both counterion binding and hydrogen bonding network between lipid
headgroups \cite{petrache04}.

Binding of cations to zwitterionic PC lipid bilayers has been previously
evaluated against experiments using the changes of headgroup order parameters
as a function of ion concentration \cite{catte16}. This is less straighforward
for charged lipid bilayers because counterions are always present and the
ion free reference state does not exist.
In addition, the analysis is complicated by the artificial aggregation of counterions
in solution observed in some simulations (section \ref{mixtureTOadditionalCIs} in the supplementary information).
Therefore, we evaluate the amount of bound charge also using the changes of
headgroup order parameters with increasing amount of negatively charged lipids in the bilayer.
According to the electrometer concept, the headgroup order parameters of POPC
increase when negativaly charged POPS lipids are incorporated in lipid bilayer
(section \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol})~\cite{seelig87,scherer87}.
This is reproduced in the MacRog simulations with potassium counterions (Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPS})
having the weakest binding affinity to POPS lipid bilayers (Fig.~\ref{NAdensPOPS}).
The CHARMM36 and Berger simulations predict no change or decrease
in the POPC headgroup order parameters as a function of increased amount of POPS (Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPS}).
This can be explained by the stronger counterion binding affinity which cancels
the effect of negatively charged headgroups and prevents the experimentally observed
increase of headgroup order parameters with increasing amount of PS lipids.
Therefore, we suggest that the relatively weak binding of potassium
in the MacRog simulations (Fig. \ref{NAdensPOPS}) predicts the most
realistic surface charge density in membranes containing PS lipids,
while the other tested simulation models overestimate the counterion
binding affinity. The results are in line with the changes of headgroup order
parameters as a function of added counterions analyzed in section \ref{mixtureTOadditionalCIs}
in the supplementary information.

The reduced forking of the POPS $\alpha$-carbon (Fig.~\ref{HGorderparametersPSvsPC})
together with other experimental results suggest less rigid structure of PS headgroups when diluted with
POPC~\cite{browning80,buldt81,roux90,roux91,scherer87}.
None of the tested models reproduce the changes of POPS headgroup order
parameters with increasing amount of POPC in POPC:POPS mixtures (Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPSvsPC}).
Therefore, we conclude that more accurate force fields are necessary
to correctly describe the PC-PS headgroup interactions in MD simulations.

Calcium binding affinity to membranes containing negative charged PS lipids can be
measured by detecteding the PC lipid headgroup order parameters
from POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures (section~\ref{electrometerFORmixtures}),
where the dehydrated lipid-ion complexes and phase separation are 
not observed~\cite{feigenson86,mattai89,roux90,roux91}.
Despite the lack of ion free reference state
in the presence of negatively charged lipids, the simulations give
coherent results for POPC headgroup order parameters as a function of
CaCl$_2$ in the POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures (Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPS}).
As expected from the previous study of pure PC lipid
bilayers \cite{catte16}, almost all the tested simulation models overestimate the
experimentally observed~\cite{roux90} decrease of the POPC headgroup order parameters
in POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures as a function of Ca$^{2+}$ concentration (Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPS}),
indicating overestimated calcium binding binding affinity.
Only exception is the CHARMM36 model with the NBfix
interaction employed for calcium~\cite{kim16}, which underestimates the changes in order parameter 
indicating weaker binding affinity than experiments.
%incorporated in the parameters give by the CHARMM-GUI at the time of running the simulations (January 2018),
Notably, CHARMM36 simulations with the NBfix corrections \cite{venable13,kim16} give similar binding affinities of
calcium and sodium to POPC bilayer (see section \ref{CHARMMcalciumNBfix}), in contrast to the experimental 
data~\cite{cevc90,akutsu81,altenbach84}. Therefore, we conclude that the calcium binding affinity
is underestimated in CHARMM36 simulations with the NBfix for calcium \cite{kim16} but overestimated 
in all the other tested models. This is evident in the calcium density distributions
along membrane normal where almost all Ca$^{2+}$ ions bind to the membrane interface in
all simulation models except CHARMM36 (Fig. \ref{CAdensPCPSmixture}).


The headgroup order parameters of POPS measured from POPC:POPS (5:1) mixture
exhibit a strong dependence of CaCl$_2$ with small concentrations and rapid saturation
below 100 mM (Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPS}).
The order parameter of POPS $\beta$-carbon increase and the larger $\alpha$-carbon 
decrease with the added CaCl$_2$ in experiments. Slight increase is observed in
the smaller $\alpha$-carbon. All the changes are significantly overestimated in the
tested simulation models, including the CHARMM36 with underestimated binding affinity.
In addition, different simulation models predict qualitatively different behaviour
for the POPS $\alpha$-carbon order parameters with the added calcium.
For example, both order parameters decrease in Berger simulations but increase
in MacRog simulations, while behaviour in Lipid14/17 and CHARMM36 simulations is
more complicated. This is in contrast to the PC headgroup, where
qualitatively correct reponse to the bound ions is observed
in all simulation models despite of the significant discrepancies in the headgroup
structure without additional ions~\cite{catte16}. Therefore, we conclude that
the improvement of force fields is necessary to correctly describe interactions between
PS headgroup and calcium ions in MD simulations.

\section{Conclusions}
Lipids with PS headgroups and their interactions with ions
play an important role in lipid mediated signaling
processes \cite{leventis10,yeung08}. Recent studies using molecular
dynamics simulations to interpret the various spectroscopic data
give contradictory results for the calcium binding details to PS
headgroups \cite{melcrova16,valentine18,hallock18}.  
Here, we used the headgroup C-H bond order parameters and open collaboration method to evaluate the quality
of headgroup structure and ion binding affinity to PS lipids
in available MD simulation force fields,
as previously done for PC lipids \cite{botan15,catte16}.
The main advantage of this approach is the direct connection
between accurately measured experimental order parameters and simulations
which reduces the ambiguity in the interpretation of experiments.

First, we complemented the available experimental data of PS
lipid headgroup order parameters \cite{browning80,roux90} by measuring the signs of the order parameters.
None of the available force fields tested using the NMRlipids open
collaboration was accurate enough to reproduce the PS
headgroup order parameters with the experimental accuracy, but
the best models suggested a characteristic rigid conformation for the
carboxyl group in the serine headgroup. Comparison to the previously
measured headgroup order parameters from POPC:POPS (5:1) bilayers with different ion
concentrations \cite{roux90} showed that the tested MD simulation force fields
overestimate the cation binding affinity to the negatively charged bilayers
containing PS lipids with two exceptions. The apparently most realisitic monovalent ion binding
affinity to PS containing lipid bilayers was observed in the MacRog
simulations with potassium counterions and the CHARMM36 force field with recently introduced
NBfix correction for calcium \cite{kim16} underestimated the calcium binding affinity.
However, the experimentally measured trends of the PS headgroup order parameter response
to the bound calcium and to the dilution of bilayer with zwitterionic PC lipids were not
qualitatively reproduced in any of the tested force fields, indicating that improvements in
the MD simulation force fields are necessary to study interactions between PS lipids and other biomolecules.
This is different to the previous results with PC lipids,
where the experimentally measured headgroup order parameter responses to the bound charge
were qualitative reproduced even thought the headgroup structures without ions were not
correct and the cation binding affinities were overestimated \cite{catte16}.

Our results pave the way for the development of better MD simulations force fields
for PS lipids. Using the headgroup order parameters, we were able to evaluate the
quality of various conformational ensembles in different force fields.
This can guide the development of force fields that would correctly reproduce the
conformations sampled by PS headgroups. The experimental dataset of headgroup order
parameters from POPC:POPS (5:1) mixture with different cation concentrations can
be used to improve cation binding details in the force fields, as recently demonstrated
for POPC using the electronic continuum correction \cite{melcr18}.
Similar study for POPS is progressed separately \cite{ECCpops}.
