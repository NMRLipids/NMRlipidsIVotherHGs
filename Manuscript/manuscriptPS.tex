\section{Introduction}
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most common negatively
charged lipid in eykaryotic membranes.
PS lipids compose 8.5\% of total lipid weight of erythrocytes,
but the abundance varies between different organelles up to
25-35\% in plasma membrane \cite{lemmon08,leventis10,li14}.
Despite of the relatively low abundance, PS lipids
are important signaling molecules. They interact with
signaling proteins \cite{leventis10}, regulate
surface charge and protein localization \cite{yeung08}, and
induce protein aggregation \cite{zhao04,gorbenko06}.
Some domains spesifically interact PS lipids,
while others are attracted by general electrostatics and the
binding can be regulated by calcium \cite{leventis10}.
Therefore, the structural details
of lipid headgroups and the details of calcium binding
are crucial for the PS mediated signaling processes.

The structure of PS lipid headgroups and their 
interactions with ions have been studied with
various experimental methods and theoretical techniques \cite{roux90,melcrova16,??}.
However, the consesus has not been reached 
due to the difficulties to interpret the experimental data \cite{??} and
the inaccuracies in simulation models at the
headgroup region \cite{botan15,catte16,ollila16}.
Some studies propose that the negatively charged lipids
attract cations only due to the increase of local concentration
in the vicinity of membranes and that the binding constant of cations is similar
to zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids \cite{seelig90,sinn06,??}.
On the other hand, some studies propose specific binding of calcium directly to PS lipid
headgroups \cite{vernier09,boettcher11,??},
The NMR data proposes that the PS headgroup is more rigid than PC,PE or PG
headgroups, but more detailed interperetation has not been done.

%Details of negatively charged lipids and their interactions
%with ions and proteins have been experimentally analyzed with
%various spectroscopic methods \cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux90,seelig90,pan14,melcrova16,??}
%NMR \cite{seelig90,??}, scattering \cite{pan14,??} and fluorescence spectroscopy
%which are often complemented with classical MD simulations \cite{pan14,melcrova16,??}.


Headgroup and glycerol backbone C-H bond order parameters
calculated from MD simulations have been
recently used to interpret the lipid structures in NMR experiments
and to validate lipid structure and ion binding in simulations of
PC lipid bilayers \cite{botan15,catte16,ollila16,ferreira16}.
In this work we apply this approach to PS lipid headgroup
in order to elucidate the structural details and ion binding
to negatively charged lipids. The results are expected to elucidate
also PS mediated signalling events because 
glycerol backbone and headgroup structure and behaviour are similar
in model membranes and in bacteria \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90}.


%In NMRlipids I and II project we were looking for a MD model
%which would correctly reproduce headgroup and glycerol
%backbone structures and cation binding for PC lipid bilayers \cite{botan15,catte16}.
%Here we extend the same goal for lipids with negatively charged PS headgroup.
%Chemical structure of PS headgroup together with other common biological
%lipids is shown in Fig. \ref{lipids}.

%  \caption{\label{lipids}
%    Chemical structures and labels for the headgroup carbons.
%  }
%\end{figure}


%The interpretation of this data and some other results has been that \cite{seelig90}
%\begin{displayquote}
%  {\it ''(i) Ca$^{2+}$ binds to neutral lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine) and negatively charged lipids
%    (phosphatidylglycerol) with approximately the same binding constant of K = 10-20 M$^{-1}$; \\
%    (ii) the free Ca$^{2+}$
%    concentration at the membrane interface is distinctly enhanced if the membrane carries a negative surface
%    charge, either due to protein or to lipid; \\
%    (iii) increased inter-facial Ca$^{2+}$ also means increased amounts
%    of bound Ca$^{2+}$ at neutral and charged lipids; \\
%    (iv) the actual binding step can be described by a Langmuir
%    adsorption isotherm with a 1 lipid:1 Ca$^{2+}$ stoichiometry, provided the interfacial concentration C$_M$, is
%    used to describe the chemical binding equilibrium.''}
%\end{displayquote}




%Phospholipids containing various polar headgroups and acyl
%chains are essential building blocks of biological membranes.
%Atomistic level structural details of lipids and lipid-ion 
%interactions are considered highly important in several
%biological processes. The lipid structure and ion binding
%can be studied in detail with NMR spectroscopy. However,
%the structural interpretation of NMR data requires usage
%of models. The combination of classical molecular dynamics
%simulations with NMR data, especially with C-H bond
%order parameters, can potentially give atomistic resolution
%interpretation of structure and dynamics of molecules \cite{botan15,ollila16,ferreira16}. 

%Our recent studies concluded that MD models are cabable to
%give structural interpretation for phosphatidylcholine 
%hydrophopic acyl chain region, while hydrophilic headgrop, glycerol 
%backbone and cation binding posed a major challenge for current
%force fields \cite{botan15,ollila16,catte16,ferreira16}. 
%These conclusions were reached by reviewing extensively 
%available experimental data from various sources and using
%NMRlipids Open Collaboration project to collect massive 
%amount of simulation data \cite{botan15,catte16}.

%Here we apply the same approach in search of MD simulation
%models which would reproduce glycerol backbone and 
%headgroup structures of lipids with PE, PG and PS headgroups.  
%In addition, we attempt to find a MD simulation model
%that would be able to correctly describe cation binding in
%bilayer containing negatively charged PG and PS lipids.


%Several MD simulation models have succesfully described 
%acyl chain structures and their qaulitative changes in different
%conditions for phosphatidylcholine lipids (for review see \cite{ollila16}).
%However, the current simulation models were not found to be accurate
%enough for full structural interpretation of phosphatidylcholine headgroup and
%glycerol backbone \cite{botan15}. Also Na$ +$  binding affinities
%were found to be significantly overestimated in several models and 
%none of the available models was able to Ca$2+$ 

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Solid state NMR experiments}
The magnitude and signs of the C-H bond order parameters in
headgroup and glycerol backbone were measured
using natural abundance $^{13}$C solid state NMR spectroscopy as
described previously \cite{ferreira13,ferreira16}.
Shortly, the absolute values of the order parameters were determined from the dipolar splittings
given by the indirect dimension of 2D R-PDFL experiment \cite{dvinskikh04} and
the signs were measured using S-DROSS experiments \cite{gross97}.

\todo{Details of the used spectrometer and maybe some other details should be given.}
\todo{Sample preparation should be described.}

\subsection{Molecular dynamics simulations}
Molecular dynamics simulation data was collected using
the Open Collaboration method \cite{botan15}.
The NMRlipids project blog (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}) and
the GitHub repository (\url{github.com/NMRLipids/NMRlipidsIVotherHGs})
were used as the communication platforms.
The simulated systems are listed in Table \ref{IONsystems} and
simulation details are given in the SI.
The simulation data is also indexed in the
searchable database (\url{nmrlipids.fi}),
and in the NMRlipids/MATCH GitHub repository (\url{https://github.com/NMRLipids/MATCH}).

\subsection{Headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters measured from POPS lipid bilayer}

Figure \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson} summarizes the experimental NMR results for POPS bilayer sample.
showing one single
    splitting for beta (which gives an order parameter equal to 0.12), and for alpha a superposition
    of a large splitting (order parameter equal to 0.09) and a very small splitting which cannot
    resolved with the available resolution.
    S-DROSS slice for beta clearly shows that the order parameter is negative,
    which is confirmed by SIMPSON simulations using the 
    The S-DROSS slice for alpha suggests that the higher order parameter is positive
    and the deviation towards negative values in the longer t1 times suggests
    that the smaller order parameter is negative.
    This is confirmed by SIMPSON simulation using value of 0.09
    for the larger alpha order parameter and the value of -0.02 for
    smaller (black curve). The value for the smaller
    alpha order parameter for SIMPSON calculation was taken from Fig 3 in Ref. \citenum{roux91},
    because resolution in 13C NMR experiments was nor high enough to determine
    numerical value for this. The S-DROSS curve from SIMPSON simulation with positive value
    for the smaller order parameter (dashed grey), did not agree with experiments 
    confirming the interpretation that the smaller order parameter is negative.

The headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of 
POPS measured in this work are compared to the literature values of
DOPS \cite{browning80} and POPC \cite{ferreira13} in Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}. 
Our results for POPS are in good agreement with the previously reported
values for DOPS measured with $^2$H NMR. Significant differences are
observed between PC and PS lipids, especially at the headgroup region.  
Previous discussions in the literature have concluded that  
glycerol backbone structure is largely similar in
PC, PE, PG and PS lipids \cite{gally81}. The headgroup region was
found to be similar in PC, PE and PG lipid (assuming that the signs of PE and PG
order parameters are the same as in PC), while the PS headgroup was suggested
to be more rigid \cite{wohlgemuth80,buldt81}. 
The detailed structural differences between the headgroups is, however, not known.

\end{figure}

The headgroup order parameters of DOPS and POPS bilayers 
from different simulation models are compared with the experimental
data in Fig. \ref{HGorderParametersPS}. In line with the previous
study for PC lipids \cite{botan15}, the glycerol backbone order 
parameters in CHARMM36 roughly agree with the experimental data,
while significant discrepancies for glycerol backbone carbons
are observed in other models.
\todo{Discussion is to be finished.} \\
\todo{Also the discussion about POPS/OPPS issue with MacRog model should be added.}


Based on the subjective ranking shown in Fig. \ref{comparisonTablePS},
the CHARMM36 is the best performing model for both lipids.
However, none of the tested models give a satisfactory 
agreement with experiments for the headgroup order paramaters of 
PS lipids. The total deviation from the experiments ($\Sigma$ in Fig. \ref{comparisonTablePS})
for the best performing CHARMM36 model is larger for PS lipids (8)
than for PC (3) \cite{botan15}. Therefore the 
interpretation of structural details of PS headgroup or
differences between PC and PS lipids is very challenging 
from the current MD simulation models.
Figures \ref{dihedralsGLY} and \ref{dihedralsHG} show dihedral
angle distributions calculated from different models. 
The glycerol backbone structures from CHARMM36 and
Slipids simulations visualized in Fig. \ref{glycerol_buslaev} reveal the
missing structures in Slipids model, which probably lead to the incorrect
order parameters. For the headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbon order parameters of PS lipids,
the tested models perform less well than for PC headgroup in previous
study \cite{botan15}.
\todo{Discussion is to be finished.
  One possible conclusion could be the following:
  The main differences between the models in the headgroup region are observed
  for dihedrals C12-C11-O12-P and C11-C12-C13-O1A.
  CHARMM36, CHARMM36UA and Slipids give very similar results to the
  dihedral C11-C12-C13-O1A, which is close to the $\beta$-carbon.
  The order parameters of $\beta$-carbons for these three models
  are in best argeement with the experiments in figure \ref{HGorderParametersPS}.
  On the other hand, Gromos-CKP models give better order parameters
  for $\alpha$-carbon than Slipids, CHARMM36 or CHARMM36UA. 
  In conclusion, the suggestion would be that the single peak for
  observed at 120 degrees in CHARMMs and Slipids would
  be more realistic for C11-C12-C13-O1A dihedral, while the single peak at 180 degrees observed
  in CKP models and in Berger would be most realistic for C12-C11-O12-P dihedral.

\subsection{Counterion binding to lipid bilayers containing PS lipids}
Since systems with negatively charged PS lipids always contain counterions
and the ion binding presumably affects the PS headgroup
order parameters, the discussion of ion binding affinity and
headgroup structure cannot be separated as done previously
for PC lipids \cite{botan15,catte16}. The density profiles
of counterions along membrane normal from different simulations
show significant binding of counterions in bilayers in all
models in Fig. \ref{NAdensPOPS}.
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Figs/NAdensPOPS.eps}
  \caption{\label{NAdensPOPS}
    Counterion densities of POPS lipid bilayer along the membrane normal from
    simulations with different force fields.
  }
\end{figure}
Differences are, however,
observed in the total binding affinity and in the shape of density profiles.
Comparison of bulk concentrations suggests that strongest binding
is observed in MacRog, Berger and Lipid17 models, respectively.
Other models gives roughly similar total binding affinity
based on rough comparison of bulk concentrations.
In CHARMM36, CHARMM36ua and Gromos-CKP models two maxima are observed
in sodium density plots, possible corresponding binding to phoshate
and carboxylic grops in the PS headgroup. In other models only
a single maxima is observed. \todo{More quantitative analysis of
binding positions and affinity may be useful.}

Based on previous simulation results it has been suggested that
the counterion binding and concomitant screening of headgroup repulsion
leads to smaller area per lipid in PS lipid bilayers than in PC
bilayers \cite{pandit02,mukhopadhyay04,pedersen06}. Therefore we also show the area per lipid from different models
in Fig. \ref{NAdensPOPS}. The proposed trend is observed for Lipid17 model,
for which the Joung-Cheatham ions give higher affinity and smaller area
per molecule. However, the trend is not observed when comparing accross different
force fields. For example, CHARMM36ua and MacRog give similar area per molecule
but binding affinity is significantly higher in MacRog. On the other hand,
Gromos-CKP models gives a larger area per lipid than other models, being only
in agreement with experiments \cite{pan14}, but the binding affinity is comparable
to the CHARMM36, CHARMM36us and Slipids, which give smaller are per molecule.

In order to compare the sodium interaction with PS containing membranes between
experiments and simulations, Fig. \ref{PSresponseTONaCl} shows the headgroup
order parameters of POPC and POPS measured from 5:1 mixture as a
function of different monovalent ions added to the buffer.
The experimental experimental results \cite{roux86} are compared with different simulation
models.

    The values from counterion-only systems are set as a zero point of y-axis.

  \todo{Maybe we should get the CHARMM results as well?}
\end{figure*}
In line with the trend observed for bilayers in the absence of negatively
charged lipids \cite{??}, the POPC headgroup order parameter response to lithium ions is
significantly larger than to potassium, indicating stronger binding of lithium
ions to lipid bilayers. The unique nature of lithium is also evident in the
response of PS headgroup order parameters to bounds ions, which decrease
with the addition of lithium or divalent cations but increase with the
addition of sodium or potassium. The headgroup order parameter response
to the added NaCl in the Berger model is similar to the experiments of LiCl,
except for the $\alpha$ carbon of POPS for which the change is overestimated
with the order of magnitude. The results suggests that the binding affinity
of sodium is overestimated by the Berger model, in line with the previous results \cite{catte16},
and that the response of $\alpha$ carbon of POPS to the added sodium
is significantly overestimated. The response of POPC to the added potassium
in MacRog model is only slightly overestimated, in contrast to the response
of POPS where order of magnitude overestimations of reposonse are observed. 
In conclusion, it seems that the response of PS headgroup to bound cations
is not correctly captured in the tested models.

\subsection{Headgroup structure in PS and PC mixtures}
Cellular membranes often compose of mixtures of zwitterionic and negatively
charged lipids. The response of PC headgroup to mixtures of differently charged
lipids are collected from different experiments in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}.
As expected from the electrometer concept \cite{seelig87}, the headgroup 
order parameters increase with the addition of negatively charged PS and PG lipids,
decrease when mixed with positively charged surfactants and
are less affected by the addition of zwitterionic PE lipids or cholesterol.
In addition to the results summarized in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol},
also mixtures of PC with negatively charged PI, CL, PA, and zwitterionic SM
follow the eletrometer concept \cite{scherer87}.

%Also the Ca2+ binding affinity to bilayers containing
%PS lipids is measured from mixtures with PC, because pure PS
%bilayers exhibit instant transition to the ordered phase with the
%addition of the ions.
%Therefore, the characterization of mutual interactions
%between PC and PS lipid headgroups is necessary in order to
%understand PS lipids in biological environments.

Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPS} shows the PC and PS headgroup order parameters
from POPC:POPS mixtures with various mole fractions from 
simulations and experiments \cite{scherer87,roux90}.
The experimentally observed increase of PC headgroup order parameters with the increasing
amount of negatively charged PS lipid is reproduced in
MacRog simulations with potassium counterions, but not in CHARMM36 simulations
with potassium or sodium conterions. The results can be
understood from the counterion density distributions shown in Fig. \ref{CIdensPSOCmixt}.
Both counterions are more strongly bound to bilayers in
CHARMM36 simulations than potassium in MacRog simulation.
The cation binding probably neutralizes the effect of negatively
charged lipids in CHARMM36 simulations, while the
weaker binding of potassium in MacRog simulations enables the
increase of order parameters with the added amount of PS.
\todo{This discussion will be finalized when we have the
results for monovalent ions also from other simulations.}

%$\beta$-carbon of POPC decreases and almost negligible increase is 
%seen in $\alpha$ order parameter with the addition of PS lipid 
%This may indicate incorrect interactions between PC and PS headgroups
%in simulations. On the other hand, the previously reported overestimated
%ion binding affinity may also play a role, as the amount of counterions
%is increasing with PS.
%\todo{Data from other force fields to be collected before discussion can be finalized.}

\end{figure*}

Also the headgroup order parameters of POPS mixed with varying amounts of POPC
from simulations and experiments \cite{borle85,roux90} are shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPS}.
The $\beta$-carbon order parameter of POPS slightly decreases and positive 
order parameter of $\alpha$-carbon slightly increases with increasing
amount of PS lipids. This may indicate increasing order of the headgroup.
\todo{The existing literature about this should be mentioned/discussed.}
It should be, however, noted that the experimental data for pure POPS and
POPC/POPS mixture come from different experimental sets, 13C NMR in this work
and 2H NMR from Ref. \citenum{roux90}, respectively. Therefore the accuracy
of the order parameter change is not as high as typically in the measurements
of order parameter changes, see discussion about qualitative and quantitative 
accuracy in Ref. \citenum{ollila16}. The changes of PS headgroup order parameters
are not reproduced by the tested simulation models. The $\beta$-carbon order parameter
increase with increasing amount of PS in CHARMM36 and MacRog simulations in contrast
to the experimental data. The smaller $\alpha$-carbon order parameter increase in both
simulation models with increasing amount of PS, while it is almost unchanged in experiments.
The larger $\alpha$-carbon order parameter increase in MacRog and decrease in CHARMM36
with increasing amount of PS, both model exhibiting a poor agreement with experiments. 
Signifincant improvement in the MD simulation models are needed to interpret the
PS headgroup structures and mutual interactions with PC lipids. 
\todo{This discussion should be updated.}

\subsection{Ca$^{2+}$ binding affinity in bilayers with negatively charged PS lipids}

The headgroup order parameters of PC lipids
decrease proportionally to the bound positive
charge in to a bilayer \cite{seelig87,catte16} and can be
therefore used to measure the ion binding
affinity. This molecular electrometer concept can
be also applied to lipid bilayers with mixtures
of PC and negatively charged lipids \cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux90}
(see Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%This is demonstrated in Fig. %s \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl},
%\ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M} and
%using the previuosly reported experimental data
%for mixtures with varying proportions of
%negatively charged PS or PG lipids.
%
%the changes of PC headgroup order parameters %for PC headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons
%as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration are shown
%
% (see Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}).



%PC headgroup order parameters increase when negatively charged
%PS or PG are added to PC bilayer in the absense of added CaCl$_2$,
%as expected based on electrometer concept \cite{seelig87}
%(see Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%In electrometer concept this is explained by the tilting of
%headgroup more parallel to membrane normal \cite{??}.

%Order parameters reach the values of pure PC bilayer close to CaCl$_2$ concentrations of $\sim$ 50-300mM.
%At this point the Ca2+ binding presumably fully cancels the charge from negative lipids and
%overcharging occurs above these concenterations.


The headgroup order parameter changes of POPC and POPS from POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures
are shown in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPS} as a function of Ca$^{2+}$ concentration from different
simulations and experiments \cite{roux90}. 
The ion density distributions from the simulations are shown in Fig. \ref{CAdensPCPSmixture}.
The results suggest that Ca$^{2+}$ ions clearly overbind in simulations with
MacRog and Berger models, as expected from previous results for PC lipid bilayers \cite{catte16}.
It should be noted, however, that the lowest concentration (100mM) gives
a good agreemet with experiments
\todo{Should be analyze/discuss this further?
  Binding with $\sim$100 mM is saturated in both Berger and MacRog simulations. Maybe this is realistic?
It should be noted that Berger simulation do not have counterions.}.
Surprisingly, the calcium binding seems to be too weak CHARMM36 simulations.
This is due to the NBfix interaction parameters from Ref. \citenum{kim16}, incorporated
in the parameters from CHARMM-GUI at the time of running the simulations (January 2018).
The binding of calcium to pure POPC bilayer is also too weak with these parameters
as shown in Figs. \ref{OP_CHARMM_CaCl_POPC_NBFix} and \ref{density_profile_CHARMM_CaCl_POPC_NBFix}.

Also the order parameters of PS headgroup from POPC:POPS (5:1) mixture
are shown in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPS} as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration.
In experiments the order parameters exhibit a strong dependence of CaCl$_2$ with
small concentrations with a rapid saturation around 50 mM. 
The changes of PS headgroup order parameters with added CaCl$_2$ are overestimated in
all tested simulation models. Furthermore, the changes of the headgroup order parameters
do not qualitatively agree with experiments. This is in contrast to previous results
for PC headgroup \cite{catte16}, where qualitatively correct reponse to bound ions was
observed despite of significant discrepancies in the headgroup structure without additional ions.

\section{PC lipid headgroup response to different mixtures in experiments}
As shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}, order parameters of PC
headgroup behave in various lipid mixtures as expected from the electrometer concept \cite{seelig87, scherer87},
i.e., order parameters increase when anionic lipids are mixed with PC and decrease with cationic
surfactants. The changes with the addition of neutral lipids is significantly smaller.

Before using the headgroup order parameters to compare ion binding affinity between simulations
and experiments, it is important to quantify the response of the order parameters to the
bound charge in simulations.
The response of headgroup order parameters to the fixed amount of cationic surfactants in
POPC bilayer is compared between simulations and experiments \cite{scherer89} In Fig. \ref{CHANGESwithCaClPGPS}.
The figure shows that the order parameters are too sensitive to bound charge in Lipid14 model,
while CHARMM36 is in better agreement with experiments. This has to be taken into account when
analysin the binding affinities.

The experimental results show essentially no changes in the order parameters as a function of
added NaCl, while significant changes are observed in simulations. However,
the minimum buffer concentration of NaCl in the experimental was 100mM \cite{roux86}.
Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the NaCl induced changes were already
saturated with 100mM NaCl concentration, which was the case for CaCl$_2$ in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPS}.

\section{Details of the rough subjective force field ranking (Fig.~\ref{comparisonTablePS})} 

The assessment was based fully on the Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}.
%
First, for each carbon (the columns in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}) in each force field (the rows),
we looked separately at deviations in magnitude and forking.

{\bf Magnitude} deviations, i.e., how close to the experimentally obtained C--H order parameters (OPs)
the force-field-produced OPs were.
%
For each carbon, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {More than half of all the calculated OPs (that is, of all different hydrogens in all different lipids) were within the {\it subjective sweet spots} (SSP, blue-shaded areas in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}).}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.03$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.05$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.10$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large M}}):] \noindent {Some of the calculated OPs  were $> 0.10$ units  away from the SSP.}
\end{description}

{\bf Forking} deviations, i.e., how well the difference in order parameters of two hydrogens attached to a given carbon matched that obtained experimentally. Note that this is not relevant for $\beta$ and $\mathrm{g_2}$, which have only one hydrogen. For the $\alpha$ carbon,  for which a considerable forking of 0.105 is experimentally seen, the following 5-step scale was used:
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {The distance $D$ between the dots (that mark the measurement-time-weighted averages in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}) was $0.08 < D< 0.13$ units for all the calculated OPs (that is, for all different lipids).}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$(0.06 < D < 0.08)$ OR $(0.13 < D < 0.15)$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$(0.04 < D < 0.06)$ OR $(0.15 < D < 0.17)$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$(0.02 < D < 0.04)$ OR $(0.17 < D < 0.19)$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$(D<0.02)$ OR $(0.19<D)$.}
\end{description}
%
For the $\mathrm{g_3}$ carbon, for which no forking is indicated by experiments, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {$ D< 0.02$.}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$0.02 < D < 0.04$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$0.04 < D < 0.06$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$0.06 < D < 0.08$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$0.08 < D$.}
\end{description}
%
For the $\mathrm{g_1}$ carbon, for which a considerable forking of 0.13 is experimentally seen, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {$0.11 < D < 0.15$.}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$(0.09 < D < 0.11)$ OR $(0.15 < D < 0.17)$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$(0.07 < D < 0.09)$ OR $(0.17 < D < 0.19)$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$(0.05 < D < 0.07)$ OR $(0.19 < D < 0.21)$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$(D<0.05)$ OR $(0.21<D)$.}
\end{description}

Based on these assessments of magnitude and forking deviations,
each carbon was then assigned to one of the following groups:
"within experimental error"
(magnitude and forking deviations both on step 0 of the scales described above),
"almost within experimental error"
(sum of the magnitude and forking deviation steps 1 or 2),
"clear deviation from experiments"
(sum of magnitude and forking deviation steps from 3 to 5), and
"major deviation from experiments"
(sum of magnitude and forking deviation steps from 6 to 8).
These groups are indicated by colors in Fig.~4.
(Note that for $\beta$ and $\mathrm{g_2}$, for which there can be no forking,
the corresponding group assigment limits were: 0, 1, 2, and 3.)

Finally, the total ability of the force field to describe the headgroup and
glycerol structure was estimated.
To this end, the groups were given the following weights:
0 (within experimental error),
1 (almost within experimental error),
2 (clear deviation from experiments),
4 (major deviation from experiments),
and the weights of the five carbons were summed up.
The sum, given in the $\Sigma$-column of Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS},
was then used to (roughly and subjectively, as should be clear from the
above description) rank the force fields.
