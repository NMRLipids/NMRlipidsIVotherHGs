\section{Introduction}
Cellular membranes are composed of mixtures of zwitterionic
and negatively charged lipids. Negatively charged lipids are important for
the signalling and lateral organization of cellular membranes \cite{li4}.
Direct interactions of cations and proteins with negatively charged
lipids have been proposed to trigger signaling events \cite{li14,??}.
On the other hand, it has been proposed that negatively charged lipids 
only increase the local concentration of cations in the vicinity of
the membrane and that the binding constant of cations is similar
to zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids \cite{seelig90,??}.

Details of negatively charged lipids and their interactions
with ions and proteins have been experimentally analyzed with
various spectroscopic methods \cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux90,seelig90,pan14,melcrova16,??}
%NMR \cite{seelig90,??}, scattering \cite{pan14,??} and fluorescence spectroscopy
which are often complemented with classical MD simulations \cite{pan14,melcrova16,??}.
The structure of negatively charged lipids and their detailed
interactions with ions or proteins have not, however, been fully resolved
due to the difficulties to interpret the experimental data \cite{??} and
the inaccuracies in simulation models at the
headgroup region \cite{botan15,catte16,ollila16}.

Headgroup and glycerol backbone C-H bond order parameters
calculated from MD simulations have been
recently used to interpret the lipid structures in NMR experiments
and to validate lipid structure and ion binding in simulations of
PC lipid bilayers \cite{botan15,catte16,ollila16,ferreira16}.
In this work we apply the same approach to negatively charged
phosphatidylserine lipids (PS) which compose   
25-35\% of plasma membrane \cite{li14,??}, regulate
surface charge and protein localization \cite{yeung08}, and
induce protein aggregation \cite{zhao04,??}.

%In NMRlipids I and II project we were looking for a MD model
%which would correctly reproduce headgroup and glycerol
%backbone structures and cation binding for PC lipid bilayers \cite{botan15,catte16}.
%Here we extend the same goal for lipids with negatively charged PS headgroup.
%Chemical structure of PS headgroup together with other common biological
%lipids is shown in Fig. \ref{lipids}.
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Figs/lipids.pdf}
  \caption{\label{lipids}
    Chemical structures and labels for the headgroup carbons.
  }
\end{figure}

Glycerol backbone and headgroup structure and behaviour are similar
in model membranes and in bacteria \cite{gally81,scherer87,seelig90}.

PC lipid headgroup order parameters can used to measure ion binding
affinity, because their magnitude is proportional
to the amount of bound charge in bilayer \cite{seelig87,catte16}.
The molecular electrometer concept can be used also
for bilayers containing PC lipids mixed with charged lipids \cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux90}.
This is demonstrated in Fig. %s \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl},
%\ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M} and
\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M},
showing the changes of PC headgroup order parameters %for PC headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons
as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration in the presence of different amounts of
negatively charged PS or PG lipids.

%PC headgroup order parameters increase when negatively charged
%PS or PG are added to PC bilayer in the absense of added CaCl$_2$,
%as expected based on electrometer concept \cite{seelig87}
%(see Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaClBELOW1M}).
%In electrometer concept this is explained by the tilting of
%headgroup more parallel to membrane normal \cite{??}.
The decrease of order parameters with CaCl$_2$
is more pronounced for systems with more
negatively charged lipids.% (see Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}).
Order parameters reach the values of pure PC bilayer close to CaCl$_2$ concentrations of $\sim$ 50-300mM.
At this point the Ca2+ binding presumably fully cancels the charge from negative lipids and
overcharging occurs above these concenterations.
The interpretation of this data and some other results has been that \cite{seelig90}
\begin{displayquote}
  {\it ''(i) Ca$^{2+}$ binds to neutral lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine) and negatively charged lipids
    (phosphatidylglycerol) with approximately the same binding constant of K = 10-20 M$^{-1}$; \\
    (ii) the free Ca$^{2+}$
    concentration at the membrane interface is distinctly enhanced if the membrane carries a negative surface
    charge, either due to protein or to lipid; \\
    (iii) increased inter-facial Ca$^{2+}$ also means increased amounts
    of bound Ca$^{2+}$ at neutral and charged lipids; \\
    (iv) the actual binding step can be described by a Langmuir
    adsorption isotherm with a 1 lipid:1 Ca$^{2+}$ stoichiometry, provided the interfacial concentration C$_M$, is
    used to describe the chemical binding equilibrium.''}
\end{displayquote}




%Phospholipids containing various polar headgroups and acyl
%chains are essential building blocks of biological membranes.
%Atomistic level structural details of lipids and lipid-ion 
%interactions are considered highly important in several
%biological processes. The lipid structure and ion binding
%can be studied in detail with NMR spectroscopy. However,
%the structural interpretation of NMR data requires usage
%of models. The combination of classical molecular dynamics
%simulations with NMR data, especially with C-H bond
%order parameters, can potentially give atomistic resolution
%interpretation of structure and dynamics of molecules \cite{botan15,ollila16,ferreira16}. 

%Our recent studies concluded that MD models are cabable to
%give structural interpretation for phosphatidylcholine 
%hydrophopic acyl chain region, while hydrophilic headgrop, glycerol 
%backbone and cation binding posed a major challenge for current
%force fields \cite{botan15,ollila16,catte16,ferreira16}. 
%These conclusions were reached by reviewing extensively 
%available experimental data from various sources and using
%NMRlipids Open Collaboration project to collect massive 
%amount of simulation data \cite{botan15,catte16}.

%Here we apply the same approach in search of MD simulation
%models which would reproduce glycerol backbone and 
%headgroup structures of lipids with PE, PG and PS headgroups.  
%In addition, we attempt to find a MD simulation model
%that would be able to correctly describe cation binding in
%bilayer containing negatively charged PG and PS lipids.


%Several MD simulation models have succesfully described 
%acyl chain structures and their qaulitative changes in different
%conditions for phosphatidylcholine lipids (for review see \cite{ollila16}).
%However, the current simulation models were not found to be accurate
%enough for full structural interpretation of phosphatidylcholine headgroup and
%glycerol backbone \cite{botan15}. Also Na$ +$  binding affinities
%were found to be significantly overestimated in several models and 
%none of the available models was able to Ca$2+$

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters measured from POPS lipid bilayer}

Figs. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson} and \ref{glycerolNMR} summarize the experimental NMR results for POPS
bilayer sample. \todo{New figure, probably combining Figs. \ref{PShgSIGNSsimpson} and \ref{glycerolNMR}, should
be done. This discussion to be finished after this.}

    (a) The headgroup region of the INEPT spectrum where alpha and beta are
    identified.
    (b) The R-PDLF slices for alpha and beta showing one single
    splitting for beta (which gives an order parameter equal to 0.12), and for alpha a superposition
    of a large splitting (order parameter equal to 0.09) and a very small splitting which cannot
    resolved with the available resolution.
    (c) Points with error bars are the experimental SDROSS data.
    The thick lines are SIMPSON simulations.
    The S-DROSS slice for beta clearly shows that the order parameter is negative,
    which is confirmed by SIMPSON simulations using the order parameter value of -0.12.
    The S-DROSS slice for alpha suggests that the higher order parameter is positive
    and the deviation towards negative values in the longer t1 times suggests
    that the smaller order parameter is negative.
    This is confirmed by SIMPSON simulation using value of 0.09
    for the larger alpha order parameter and the value of -0.02 for
    smaller (black curve). The value for the smaller
    alpha order parameter for SIMPSON calculation was taken from Fig 3 in Ref. \citenum{roux91},
    because resolution in 13C NMR experiments was nor high enough to determine
    numerical value for this. The S-DROSS curve from SIMPSON simulation with positive value
    for the smaller order parameter gave did not agree with experiments (dashed grey),
    confirming the interpretation that the smaller order parameter is negative.

The headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters of 
POPS measured in this work are compared to the literature values of
DOPS \cite{browning80} and POPC \cite{ferreira13} in Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}. 
Our results for POPS are in good agreement with the previously reported
values for DOPS measured with $^2$H NMR. Significant differences are
observed between PC and PS lipids, especially at the headgroup region.  
Previous discussions in the literature have concluded that  
glycerol backbone structure is largely similar in
PC, PE, PG and PS lipids \cite{gally81}. The headgroup region was
found to be similar in PC, PE and PG lipid (assuming that the signs of PE and PG
order parameters are the same as in PC), while the PS headgroup was suggested
to be more rigid \cite{wohlgemuth80,buldt81}. 
The detailed structural differences between the headgroups is, however, not known.

\end{figure}

The headgroup order parameters of DOPS and POPS bilayers 
from different simulation models are compared with the experimental
data in Fig. \ref{HGorderParametersPS}. In line with the previous
study for PC lipids \cite{botan15}, the glycerol backbone order 
parameters in CHARMM36 and Berger force fields roughly agree with
the experimental data, but significant discrepancies are observed for
Slipids and CKP models. The glycerol backbone structures from CHARMM36 and
Slipids simulations visualized in Fig. \ref{glycerol_buslaev} reveal the
missing structures in Slipids model, which probably lead to the incorrect
order parameters. For the headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbon order parameters of PS lipids,
the tested models perform less well than for PC headgroup in previous
study \cite{botan15}. None of the tested models give a satisfactory 
agreement with experiments for the headgroup order paramaters of 
PS lipids. Based on the subjective ranking shown in Fig. \ref{comparisonTablePS},
the CHARMM36 is the best performing model for both lipids.
However, the total deviation from the experiments for the PS lipids is significantly
higher for PS lipids (8) than for PC (3) \cite{botan15}. Therefore the 
interpretation of structural differences between PC and PS lipids 
from current MD simulation models is very challenging.

  and included in the discussion. Maybe also figures similar to \ref{glycerol_buslaev}.}

\subsection{Headgroup structure in PS and PC mixtures}
Lipid mixtures containing PC and PS lipids are present in biological
systems. Also the Ca2+ binding affinity to bilayers containing
PS lipids is measured from mixtures with PC, because pure PS
bilayers exhibit instant transition to the ordered phase with the
addition of the ions. Therefore, the characterization of mutual interactions
between PC and PS lipid headgroups is necessary in order to
understand PS lipids in biological environments.

Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPS} shows the headgroup order parameters
of POPC and POPS lipids in mixtures with various mole fractions from 
simulations and experiments \cite{scherer87,roux90}.
The headgroup order parameters of POPC increase with the increasing
amount of negatively charged POPS, as expected from the 
the electrometer concept \cite{seelig87}. Notably, the concept
seems to be generally valid, at least qualitatively, also for 
other lipid mixed with PC lipids; the PC lipid headgroup order
parameters increase when mixed with negatively charged 
lipids (PS, PI, CL, PA and PG) and remains almost unchaged when 
mixed with neutral lipids (PE and SM) \cite{scherer87} or cholesterol \cite{ferreira13}.
This is, however, not reproduced in the simulation data 
in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPS}. The order parameter for
$\beta$-carbon of POPC decreases and almost negligible increase is 
seen in $\alpha$ order parameter with the addition of PS lipid in CHARMM36 simulation.
This may indicate incorrect interactions between PC and PS headgroups
in simulations. On the other hand, the previously reported overestimated
ion binding affinity may also play a role, as the amount of counterions
is increasing with PS.
\todo{Data from other force fields to be collected before discussion can be finalized.}

Also the headgroup order parameters of POPS mixed with varying amounts of POPC
from simulations and experiments \cite{borle85,roux90} are shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPS}.
The $\beta$-carbon order parameter of POPS slightly decreases and positive 
order parameter of $\alpha$-carbon slightly increases with increasing
amount of PS lipids. This may indicate increasing order of the headgroup.
It should be, however, noted that the experimental data for pure POPS and
POPC/POPS mixture come from different experimental sets, 13C NMR in this work
and 2H NMR from Ref. \citenum{roux90}, respectively. Therefore the accuracy
of the order parameter change is not as high as typically in the measurements
of order parameter changes, see discussion about qualitative and quantitative 
accuracy in Ref. \citenum{ollila16}. The changes of PS headgroup order parameters
are not reproduced by the tested simulation models. The $\beta$-carbon order parameter
increase with increasing amount of PS in CHARMM36 and MacRog simulations in contrast
to the experimental data. The smaller $\alpha$-carbon order parameter increase in both
simulation models with increasing amount of PS, while it is almost unchanged in experiments.
The larger $\alpha$-carbon order parameter increase in MacRog and decrease in CHARMM36
with increasing amount of PS, both model exhibiting a poor agreement with experiments. 
Signifincant improvement in the MD simulation models are needed to interpret the
PS headgroup structures and mutual interactions with PC lipids. 

\subsection{Ca$^{2+}$ binding affinity in bilayers with negatively charged PS lipids}

Before using headgroup order parameters to compare ion binding affinity between simulations
and experiments, the response of the order parameters to bound charge has to be quantified.
The response of headgroup order parameters to the fixed amount of cationic surfactants in
POPC bilayer is compared between simulations and experiments \cite{scherer89} In Fig. \ref{CHANGESwithCaClPGPS}.
The figure shows that the order parameters are too sensitive to bound charge in Lipid14 model,
while CHARMM36 is in better agreement with experiments. This has to be taken into account when
analysin the binding affinities.

  \caption{\label{CHANGESwithCaClPGPS}
  The response of headgroup order parameters to the fixed amount of cationic surfactants in
  POPC bilayer is compared between simulations and experiments \cite{scherer89}.}
\end{figure}

\todo{When we have more data for Ca binding to PS containing bilayers, the discussion will be updated and PG results moved
to other manuscript.}
Comparison of Ca$2+$ binding in PG between CHARMM36 simulations and experiments \cite{borle85}
is shown in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG}. The decrease of $\alpha$ order parameter
is in agreement with experiments, while decerase of $\beta$ order parameter is overestimated.
The result is very similar to the results with PC in NMRlipids II publication \cite{catte16}.
It should be, however, noted that the $\beta$-order parameters are not actually measured for PG,
but they are calculated from empirical relation $\Delta S_{\beta}=0.43\Delta S_{\alpha}$ \cite{akutsu81}.
Anyway, the data presented in NMRlipids II project and in Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPG} together
suggest that Calcium binding is similarly overestimated by CHARMM36 model in pure POPC bilayers and mixtures with
POPG. The good agreement of $\alpha$ carbon would be explained by too weak dependence of its order
parameter of bound charge

  }
\end{figure*}

Also dependence of $\beta$-carbon of PG on CaCl$_2$ concentration is compared with
experiments \cite{borle85} in Fig. \ref{PSPGchangesWITHCaCl}. Absolute value of
the order parameter is too large without ions, but rapid decrease due to addition of
CaCl$_2$ is observed in agreement with experiments for systems with 1:1 mixture of POPC and POPG.
In addition, absolute value in systems with CaCl$_2$ is in agreement with experiments.
However, system with 4:1 mixture of POPC and POPG behaves differently, but experimental
data is not available for comparison for this mixture.

\section{PC lipid headgroup response to different mixtures in experiments}
As shown in Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}, order parameters of PC
headgroup behave in various lipid mixtures as expected from the electrometer concept \cite{seelig87, scherer87},
i.e., order parameters increase when anionic lipids are mixed with PC and decrease with cationic
surfactants. The changes with the addition of neutral lipids is significantly smaller.

\section{Details of the rough subjective force field ranking (Fig.~\ref{comparisonTablePS})} 

The assessment was based fully on the Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}.
%
First, for each carbon (the columns in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}) in each force field (the rows),
we looked separately at deviations in magnitude and forking.

{\bf Magnitude} deviations, i.e., how close to the experimentally obtained C--H order parameters (OPs)
the force-field-produced OPs were.
%
For each carbon, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {More than half of all the calculated OPs (that is, of all different hydrogens in all different lipids) were within the {\it subjective sweet spots} (SSP, blue-shaded areas in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}).}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.03$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.05$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.10$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large M}}):] \noindent {Some of the calculated OPs  were $> 0.10$ units  away from the SSP.}
\end{description}

{\bf Forking} deviations, i.e., how well the difference in order parameters of two hydrogens attached to a given carbon matched that obtained experimentally. Note that this is not relevant for $\beta$ and $\mathrm{g_2}$, which have only one hydrogen. For the $\alpha$ carbon,  for which a considerable forking of 0.105 is experimentally seen, the following 5-step scale was used:
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {The distance $D$ between the dots (that mark the measurement-time-weighted averages in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}) was $0.08 < D< 0.13$ units for all the calculated OPs (that is, for all different lipids).}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$(0.06 < D < 0.08)$ OR $(0.13 < D < 0.15)$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$(0.04 < D < 0.06)$ OR $(0.15 < D < 0.17)$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$(0.02 < D < 0.04)$ OR $(0.17 < D < 0.19)$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$(D<0.02)$ OR $(0.19<D)$.}
\end{description}
%
For the $\mathrm{g_3}$ carbon, for which no forking is indicated by experiments, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {$ D< 0.02$.}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$0.02 < D < 0.04$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$0.04 < D < 0.06$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$0.06 < D < 0.08$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$0.08 < D$.}
\end{description}
%
For the $\mathrm{g_1}$ carbon, for which a considerable forking of 0.13 is experimentally seen, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {$0.11 < D < 0.15$.}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$(0.09 < D < 0.11)$ OR $(0.15 < D < 0.17)$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$(0.07 < D < 0.09)$ OR $(0.17 < D < 0.19)$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$(0.05 < D < 0.07)$ OR $(0.19 < D < 0.21)$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$(D<0.05)$ OR $(0.21<D)$.}
\end{description}

Based on these assessments of magnitude and forking deviations,
each carbon was then assigned to one of the following groups:
"within experimental error"
(magnitude and forking deviations both on step 0 of the scales described above),
"almost within experimental error"
(sum of the magnitude and forking deviation steps 1 or 2),
"clear deviation from experiments"
(sum of magnitude and forking deviation steps from 3 to 5), and
"major deviation from experiments"
(sum of magnitude and forking deviation steps from 6 to 8).
These groups are indicated by colors in Fig.~4.
(Note that for $\beta$ and $\mathrm{g_2}$, for which there can be no forking,
the corresponding group assigment limits were: 0, 1, 2, and 3.)

Finally, the total ability of the force field to describe the headgroup and
glycerol structure was estimated.
To this end, the groups were given the following weights:
0 (within experimental error),
1 (almost within experimental error),
2 (clear deviation from experiments),
4 (major deviation from experiments),
and the weights of the five carbons were summed up.
The sum, given in the $\Sigma$-column of Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS},
was then used to (roughly and subjectively, as should be clear from the
above description) rank the force fields.
