    \todo{For example this data set has pretty good description of simulation details in the

The POPC bilayer consisting of a total of 128 lipids was constructed from single lipid structure taken 
from Ref.~\cite{kulig15c}. The bilayer was hydrated by a total of 5120 water 
molecules, corresponding to 40 water molecules per lipid.

The MacRog lipid parameters \cite{kulig15b}, obtained from 
\cite{kulig15c}, were used, along with the TIP3P water model 
\cite{jorgensen83}. The simulation parameters were identical to those used for 
POPC/POPC mixtures with the MacRog force field, see below. The simulation was run for 200~ns, 
out of which \hl{??~ns: (this is not tabulated in the MS or the SI)} were used for analyses.

This membrane was further simulated after replacing Na$^+$ counterions by K$^+$ ones, which 
were described by the \AA{}qvist parameters \cite{aqvist90}. Other topologies
were unchanged. The simulation parameters were the same as used for the POPC/POPS mixtures with 
the MacRog force field, see below. The simulation was run for 200~ns, out of which 150~ns was used 
in the analyses.

\noindent
{\it POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures with additional potassium ions} \\
The data in Table \ref{mixedIONsystems} and Refs \citenum{POPCpopsMACROG,POPCpopsMACROGwithK}

The bilayers containing a total of 120 POPC and 24 POPS molecules distributed evenly among the 
two leaflets were set up using CHARMM-GUI \cite{lee16,jo18}.
The bilayers were solvated by 5760 water molecules, corresponding to 40 water molecules for lipid.
Additionally, 24 potassium ions were added to neutralize the charge of the POPS head groups.

These bilayers were simulated in the presence of counterions only, as well as together with different
concentrations of CaCl$_2$ or KCl. For the former, concentrations of 100~mM, 300~mM, 1~M, and 3~M 
were considered, which corresponded to the amounts of 10/20, 31/62, 104/208, and 311/622 
of Ca$^{2+}$/Cl$^-$ ions. For membranes with KCl, concentrations of 500~mM, 1~M, 2~M, and 3~M of 
were considered, corresponding to 52, 104, 208, or 311 pairs of K$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions.

The lipids were described using the MacRog model \cite{maciejewski14,kulig15b,rog16}. The POPC topologies were obtained from 
Ref.~\citenum{kulig15c}, whereas the POPS topology was adapted from 
Ref.~\citenum{rog16}. Notably, the chains were reversed in order to modify 
OPPS into POPS. Unlike the D stereoisomer present in Ref.~\cite{rog16}, the 
POPS head group conformations generated by CHARMM-GUI are in the naturally occurring L stereoisomer.
TIP3P model \cite{jorgensen83} was used for water, and the \AA{}qvist parameters 
\cite{aqvist90}, standard for the OPLS force field, were employed for the ions. 

The simulation parameters were taken from Ref.~\citenum{rog16}. 
Periodic boundary conditions were employed in all dimensions. The list of neighbors was updated every step 
\hl{I used nstlist=1 because it's used in the mdp in the article quoted. In DOI: 10.1021/jp5016627, nstlist=10 is used}
The Lennard-Jones interactions were cut off at 1~nm, whereas the smooth particle mesh Ewald algorithm 
\cite{essman95} was used for electrostatics. Dispersion correction \cite{shirts07} 
was applied to both energy and pressure. Temperature was kept constant at 298~K using the 
Nos\'{e}--Hoover thermostat \cite{nose84,hoover85}. The lipids and 
the solvent were coupled separately, and a time constant of 0.4~ps was employed. Pressure was 
maintained semi-isotropically at 1~bar using the Parrinello--Rahman barostat with a time constant of 1~ps 
\cite{parrinello81}. All non-water bonds were constrained with the LINCS algorithm 
\cite{hess97,hess07},
whereas the bonds in water molecules were constrained using SETTLE \cite{miyamoto92}.
The integration time step was set to 2~fs, and the simulations were performed either for 400~ns 
(only counterions), 300~ns (systems with KCl), or 600~ns (systems with CaCl$_2$). The last 
250, 200, or 300~ns of the simulations were included in the analyses, respectively.

\subsection{Lipid17}
{\it DOPS and POPS bilayers.} \\

The structure of the bilayers with 128 DOPS or 128 POPS lipids were
obtained from CHARMM-GUI~\cite{lee16,jo18}. Bilayers are solvated with
4480 water molecules resulting in 31.1 water molecules per lipid. For
each system, 128 NaCl molecules are added to neutralize the system.\\

Each bilayer structure was first minimized for 2500 steps with steepest
descent and an additional 2500 step with the conjugent gradient
algorithms while restrainig the solvent and ion molecules with a force
constant 500~kcal~mol$^{-1}$~\AA{}$^{-1}$. An additional minimization
step was used with the same parameters after removing the constraints on
the solvent and ion molecules. During the minimization procedure,
non-periodic boundary conditions were applied, no pressure scaling was
used and none of the bonds were restrained. A three step heating
procedure was applied: in the first heating step the system temperature
is increased from 0.0~K to 100.0~K using Langevin thermostat with
5.0~ps$^{-1}$ collision frequency while restraining the lipid positions
with harmonic springs of force constant
20.0~kcal~mol$^{-1}$~\AA{}$^{-1}$ at constant volume without periodic
boundary conditions. In the second heating step, the system temperature
was increased from 100.0~K to 200.0~K using Langevin thermostat with
5.0~ps$^{-1}$ collision frequency within 10000 steps while restraining
the lipid positions with harmonic springs of force constant
10.0~kcal~mol$^{-1}$~\AA{}$^{-1}$ at constant volume. In the third
heating step, the system temperature is increased from 200.0~K to
303.0~K within 10000 steps using Langevin thermostat with 5.0~ps$^{-1}$
collision frequency while restraining the lipid positions with harmonic
springs of force constant 10.0~kcal~mol$^{-1}$~\AA{}$^{-1}$ at 1~bar
constant pressure using Berendsen barostat with 3.0~ps relaxation time.
From the second heating step onward, periodic boundary conditions in all
dimensions were applied. The semi-isotropic pressure coupling along
\textit{xy}-plane was employed and the surface tension was set to
0.0~dyn explicitely. After the third heating step, each structure is
equilibriated for 100~ns at 1~bar and 303~K constant pressure using
Berendsen barostat and temperature using Langevin thermostat,
respectively. For the equilibriation step, semi-isotropic pressure
coupling along \textit{xy}-plane was employed and the surface tension
was set to 0.0~dyn explicitely. For all heating and equilibration steps,
the lengths of the hydrogen containing bonds were restrained using SHAKE
algorithm and a time step of 2~fs was used. In all steps with periodic
boundary conditions, the non-bonded interactions are calculated with
particle mesh Ewald~\cite{essman95} using 1.0~nm cutoff.\\

For the production runs, the temperature and pressure were set to 303~K
and 1~bar, using Langevin thermostat with 1.0~ps$^{-1}$ collision
frequency and Berendsen barostat with 1.0~ps relaxation time,
respectively. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all
dimensions and the non-bonded interactions are calculated with particle
mesh Ewald~\cite{essman95} using 1.0~nm cutoff. The lengths of the
hydrogen containing bonds were constrained using SHAKE algorithm and a
time step of 2~fs was used. Trajectories are saved in every 10~ps
intervals. Two independent trajectories of 500~ns long was generated and
the last 200~ns portions were used for the analysis.\\

In all simulations, TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen1983comparison} was used as the solvent. SETTLE~\cite{miyamoto92} algorithm was employed 
to constrain the bonds in TIP3P water molecules. Lipid parameters were obtained from 
Amber Lipid17 force field. For the ions, one set of simulations were run with Joung-Cheatham
ion parameters~\cite{joung2008determination} and one set of simulations were run with ff99SB~\cite{aqvist90} ion parameters. The data in Table~\ref{PSsystems} and Refs~\citenum{lipid17POPSjcions,lipid17POPSff99ions,lipid17DOPSjcions,lipid17DOPSff99ions} contain the details of the simulations and the raw trajectories, respectively.

\noindent
{\it POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures with additional potassium and sodium ions} \\

The initial structure of the bilayers with 120 POPC and 24 POPS lipids were obtained from CHARMM-GUI~\cite{lee16,jo18}. Bilayers were solvated with 5760 TIP3P water molecules~\cite{jorgensen1983comparison}. For the simulations of the lipids and ions, the Amber Lipid 17 and ff99SB force fields were used, respectively. The simulation steps are the same as the the simulations of DOPS and POPS bilayers described above, with the only difference that the total simulation time was 300~ns, of which last 200~ns was used for the analysis. The number of ions in each specific system is given in Table~\ref{mixedIONsystemsMONOVALENT}. The trajectory files can be found in Refs~\citenum{POPCpopsLIPID17withKCI,POPCpopsLIPID17withK,POPCpopsLIPID17withNaCI,POPCpopsLIPID17withNa}.\\

\section{Electrometer concept in PC lipid bilayers mixed with negatively charged lipids}\label{electrometerFORmixtures}

The electrometer concept is based on the empirical observations that
the order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in PC lipid headgroup
decrease (increase) proportionally to the bound positive (negative) 
charge~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,scherer89} (Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}). 
Therefore, the headgroup order parameters can be used to measure the
ion binding affinity to lipid bilayers containing PC
lipids~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,borle85,seelig87,macdonald87,roux90}.
Changes of the headgroup order parameters of negatively charged PS and PG lipids
are also systematic, but less well characterized~\cite{borle85,macdonald87,roux86,roux90}.
Therefore, the ion binding affinity to negatively charged bilayers
can be better characterized measuring the PC headgroup order parameters from 
mixed bilayers~\cite{borle85,roux86,macdonald87,roux90,roux91}.
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8.0cm]{../Figs/HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol.eps}
  \caption{\label{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}

    Signs are taken from separate experiments~\cite{ollila16,ferreira16}.
  }
\end{figure}

When using the PC headgroup order parameters to evaluate the ion binding affinity to a bilayer containing anionic lipids,
it is important to note that the order parameters
increase due to the addition of negative charged lipids according to the electrometer
concept~\cite{seelig87, scherer87} (Fig. \ref{HGorderparametersPCvsPEPSPGchol}).
Therefore, the PC headgroup order parameters are larger in mixtures with anionic lipids
than in pure lipid bilayers. This is evident also in the headgroup order parameters
of POPC in bilayers with different amounts anionic lipids without added calcium (Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl}).
Upon addition of CaCl$_2$, the order parameters decrease and reach the values of pure PC bilayer close 
to the CaCl$_2$ concentrations of $\sim$ 50-300mM, depending on the amount of negatively charged
lipids in the mixture (Fig. \ref{OrderParametersWithCaCl}).
Around these concentrations the positive charge of bound Ca$^{2+}$ cancels
the negative charge lipids, resulting to a neutral membrane. 
Above such concentrations, the specific binding of calcium leads to
the overcharging of the membrane.

    and for POPC:POPG (1:1) mixture data without NaCl from Ref.\citenum{borle85}.
  }
\end{figure}

Because the POPC headgroup order parameters in mixtures with different amounts of anionic lipids
but without additional salt are not equal, the binding affinity of calcium can be better compared
by plotting the changes of order parameters as a function of added calcium.
As expected, such a plot reveals more pronounced order parameter decrease in systems
with larger fractions of negatively charged lipids (Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESWithCaClBELOW1M}),
indicating an increase in the calcium binding affinity with the increasing amount of negatively charged
lipids in membranes. In conclusion, the presented empirical comparison of headgroup order parameter changes
from various mixtures of POPC and anionic lipids with added calcium gives physically
consistent results, suggesting that the electrometer concept can be used to determine
the cation binding affinity also to the lipid bilayers containing mixtures of PC and anionic lipids.

\section{Calibration of PC headgroup order parameter response to the bound cations}\label{electrometerCALIBRATION}
Before using the headgroup order parameters to compare ion binding affinity between simulations
and experiments, the response of the order parameters to the bound charge in simulations should be quantified
against experiments~\cite{catte16,melcr18}. In our previous work~\cite{catte16},
the ratio $\Delta S_{\rm CH}^\beta / \Delta S_{\rm CH}^\alpha$ was in good agreement with the experiments~\cite{akutsu81}
in the Lipid14 model, but was underestimated by other models. In the more recent study~\cite{melcr18},
the headgroup order parameter responses were compared more carefully with the experiments of
cationic dihexadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DHAB) surfactants in POPC bilayer~\cite{scherer89}.
The comparison reveals that the both headgroup order parameters in the Lipid14 model are too sensitive to the bound charge,
while CHARMM36 gives better agreement for the $\alpha$ carbon (Fig. \ref{CHANGESwithDHMDMAB}).
Therefore, the headgroup order parameter response to the bound charge is actually more realistic
in CHARMM36 model than in the Lipid14. In the latter, both order parameters are equally too 
sensitive to the bound cations giving a good result for the $\Delta S_{\rm CH}^\beta / \Delta S_{\rm CH}^\alpha$ ratio.
The ratio was overestimated for the CHARMM36 model because the $\beta$-carbon order parameter
is relatively more sensitive than the $\alpha$-carbon order parameter. These results have to be taken
into account when analysing the ion binding affinities using headgroup order parameters in simulations.
However, we conclude that the discrepancies arising from the sentivity of lipid headgroup to
bound charge are typically smaller than then discrepancies arising from ion binding affinity.

\section{Effect of the definition of concentration on the headgroup order parameters as a function of ion concentration.}\label{concentrationDEFsection}
Previous studies using the electrometer concept to assess the ion binding affinity to lipid
bilayers report ion concentrations either in water before solvating the lipids (buffer concentration) \cite{akutsu81,roux90,catte16}
or in bulk water after solvating the lipids (bulk concentration) \cite{altenbach84,melcr18}.
In this work, we use the former definition to be consistent with the reference
experimental data \cite{roux90}. The difference between these two concentrations increases
with the increasing ion binding affinity. However, the difference is essentially negligible
in the recent model \cite{melcr18} with realistic ion binding affinity (Fig. \ref{concentrationDEFfigure}).

Slices of the R-PDFL spectra (Fig. \ref{DPslices}) 
show a single splitting for the $\beta$-carbon with the order parameter value of 0.11,
and a superposition of a large and a very small splitting for the $\alpha$-carbon.
The larger splitting from the $\alpha$-carbon gives a order parameter value of 0.09, while the numerical value

\section{Dihedral angle distributions of the headgroup and glycerol backbone
  regions of PS lipids from different simulation models}

The dihedral angles and structures of the glycerol backbone and headgroup regions of POPS lipids show
wide variety between different simulation models (Figs. \ref{dihedralsHG}, \ref{dihedralsGLY} and \ref{HGandGLYstructuresPS}).
Detailed discussion of the structural differences is limited by the lack of realistic model that would correctly reproduce the
headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters. However, some structural characteristics
of PS headgroup can be suggested based on the best available models
(Figs. \ref{dihedralsHGpc}, \ref{dihedralsGLYpc} and \ref{HGandGLYstructuresPSPC}), as discussed in the main text.
The glycerol backbone structures are not discussed in this work because our focus is on PS headgroup.
However, the data presented here can be useful for future investigations.
%backbone order parameters of C$_2$ and C$_3$ from Slipids simulations
%differ significantly from the other simulation results and experiments (Fig. \ref{HGorderParametersPS}),
%as observed previously also for PC lipids \cite{botan15}.
%The origin of this difference is more difficult to track without more elaborate analysis,
%because different models show very complicated patterns of distinct structures
%in the glycerol backbone region (Figs.~\ref{HGstructuresPS} and \ref{dihedralsHG}).

\section{Headgroup response to the additional counterions in POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures}\label{mixtureTOadditionalCIs}
To evaluate counterion binding in different simulation models against experimental data~\cite{roux90},
we plot the headgroup order parameters measured from POPC:POPS 5:1 mixture
as a function of different monovalent ions added to the buffer (Fig. \ref{PSresponseTONaCl}). 
Experimental order parameters of POPC headgroup in the mixture are available as a function
of LiCl and KCl concentrations, while POPS headgroup order parameters are measured also
as a function of NaCl. Lithium interacts more strongly with PS headgroups than other monovalent 
ions~\cite{hauser83,hauser85,roux86,mattai89,roux90}, as also observed for PC headgroups~\cite{cevc90}. 
The different binding behaviour is evident also in the changes of PS headgroup order parameters, which decrease with the addition of lithium 
but increase with the addition of sodium or potassium (Fig. \ref{PSresponseTONaCl}). 
POPC headgroup order parameters exhibit a clear decrease as a function of LiCl concentration
but only modest changes as a function of KCl concentration, indicating singificant 
Li$^+$ binding but only weak K$^+$ binding to the mixture when interpreted using the
electrometer concept~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87}.

In simulations with Berger and CHARMM36 models, the responses of headgroup order parameter
of both POPC and POPS to the added sodium or potassium are more similar to the experiments
with LiCl (Fig. \ref{PSresponseTONaCl}), indicating overestimated binding affinity of sodium and potassium 
in these simulations. The MacRog simulations with potassium exhibit weaker counterion binding affinity
(Fig. \ref{CIdensPSOCmixt}), but significantly larger error bars and
less systematic changes in the order parameters (Fig. \ref{PSresponseTONaCl}).
Similar unsystematic behaviour was also observed in the simulations of Lipid14/17 model
with the additional counterions \cite{POPCpopsLIPID17withKCI,POPCpopsLIPID17withK,POPCpopsLIPID17withNaCI,POPCpopsLIPID17withNa},
for which the data is not shown due to the formation of
ion clusters in water with relatively low (1 M) ion concentrations (Fig. \ref{ionCLUSTERS}).
Appearance of such clusters also in the MagRog simulations with 4 M concentration of KCl
could explain the unsystematic changes of the order parameters in this model with the added KCl.
In conclusion, the results are in line with the section \ref{ciBINDINGsection}
in the main text, suggesting that the MacRog simulations with KCl give the most
realistic surface charge at the lipid bilayer interface among the tested simulation models.

\section{Calcium binding to POPC in CHARMM36 simulation with NBfix}\label{CHARMMcalciumNBfix}

The response of POPC headgroup order parameters to the CaCl$_2$ concentration
are underestimated in simulations of POPC:POPS (5:1) mixture with CHARMM36 containing
the NBfix for interactions between calicum and lipid oxygens \cite{kim16}
(Fig. \ref{changesWITHCaClPS} in the main text),
indicating that the calcium binding to the bilayer is too weak with these
parameters. Without the NBfix term, the calcium binding affinity to pure POPC
lipid bilayers was overestimated in the CHARMM36 model \cite{catte16}.
However, after employing the NBfix term, the response of headgroup order
parameters (Fig. \ref{OP_CHARMM_CaCl_POPC_NBFix}) and the binding affinity
(Fig. \ref{density_profile_CHARMM_CaCl_POPC_NBFix}) of calcium also to a pure
POPC bilayer are underestimated. Notably, CHARMM36 simulations with the NBfix
terms \cite{venable13,kim16} employed predict similar binding affinity for sodium and calcium.
In conclusion, the special NBfix~\cite{kim16} for calcium, 
incorporated in the parameters give by the CHARMM-GUI at the time
of running the simulations (January 2018), leads to the underestimation of
calcium binding affinity to pure PC and mixed PC:PS bilayers.

\section{Details of the rough subjective force field ranking (Fig.~\ref{comparisonTablePS})} 

The assessment was based fully on the Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}.
%
First, for each carbon (the columns in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}) in each force field (the rows),
we looked separately at deviations in magnitude and forking.

{\bf Magnitude} deviations, i.e., how close to the experimentally obtained C--H order parameters (OPs)
the force-field-produced OPs were.
%
For each carbon, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {More than half of all the calculated OPs (that is, of all different hydrogens in all different lipids) were within the {\it subjective sweet spots} (SSP, blue-shaded areas in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}).}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.03$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.05$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large M}}):] \noindent {All the calculated OPs  were $< 0.10$ units away from the SSP.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large M}}):] \noindent {Some of the calculated OPs  were $> 0.10$ units  away from the SSP.}
\end{description}

{\bf Forking} deviations, i.e., how well the difference in order parameters of two hydrogens attached to a given carbon matched that obtained experimentally. Note that this is not relevant for $\beta$ and $\mathrm{g_2}$, which have only one hydrogen. For the $\alpha$ carbon,  for which a considerable forking of 0.105 is experimentally seen, the following 5-step scale was used:
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {The distance $D$ between the dots (that mark the measurement-time-weighted averages in Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS}) was $0.08 < D< 0.13$ units for all the calculated OPs (that is, for all different lipids).}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$(0.06 < D < 0.08)$ OR $(0.13 < D < 0.15)$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$(0.04 < D < 0.06)$ OR $(0.15 < D < 0.17)$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$(0.02 < D < 0.04)$ OR $(0.17 < D < 0.19)$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$(D<0.02)$ OR $(0.19<D)$.}
\end{description}
%
For the $\mathrm{g_3}$ carbon, for which no forking is indicated by experiments, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {$ D< 0.02$.}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$0.02 < D < 0.04$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$0.04 < D < 0.06$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$0.06 < D < 0.08$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$0.08 < D$.}
\end{description}
%
For the $\mathrm{g_1}$ carbon, for which a considerable forking of 0.13 is experimentally seen, the following 5-step scale was used:
%
\begin{description}
\item [0 (~):] \noindent {$0.11 < D < 0.15$.}
%
\item [1 ({\textsf{\tiny F}}):] \noindent {$(0.09 < D < 0.11)$ OR $(0.15 < D < 0.17)$.}
%
\item [2  ({\textsf{\small F}}):] \noindent {$(0.07 < D < 0.09)$ OR $(0.17 < D < 0.19)$.}
%
\item [3 ({\textsf{\large F}}):] \noindent {$(0.05 < D < 0.07)$ OR $(0.19 < D < 0.21)$.}
%
\item [4 ({\textsf{\Large F}}):] \noindent {$(D<0.05)$ OR $(0.21<D)$.}
\end{description}

Based on these assessments of magnitude and forking deviations,
each carbon was then assigned to one of the following groups:
"within experimental error"
(magnitude and forking deviations both on step 0 of the scales described above),
"almost within experimental error"
(sum of the magnitude and forking deviation steps 1 or 2),
"clear deviation from experiments"
(sum of magnitude and forking deviation steps from 3 to 5), and
"major deviation from experiments"
(sum of magnitude and forking deviation steps from 6 to 8).
These groups are indicated by colors in Fig.~4.
(Note that for $\beta$ and $\mathrm{g_2}$, for which there can be no forking,
the corresponding group assigment limits were: 0, 1, 2, and 3.)

Finally, the total ability of the force field to describe the headgroup and
glycerol structure was estimated.
To this end, the groups were given the following weights:
0 (within experimental error),
1 (almost within experimental error),
2 (clear deviation from experiments),
4 (major deviation from experiments),
and the weights of the five carbons were summed up.
The sum, given in the $\Sigma$-column of Fig.~\ref{HGorderParametersPS},
