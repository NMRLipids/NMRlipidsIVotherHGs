# Results with PS taken from
# MATCH/Data/Lipid_Bilayers/POPS+83%popc/T298K/MODEL_CHARMM
# Counterions are sodium
#
# It should be noted that pure POPC are ran with Gromacs 4, but the results with
# PS are ran with Gromacs 5. This has significant effect on acyl chains:

# The effect for headgroups can be estimated by comparing these two data sets:

# It might be good to run pure POPC at T298K with Gromacs 5 for the comparison.
