# Results with PS taken from http://nmrlipids.blogspot.com/2017/12/nmrlipids-iv-current-status-and.html?showComment=1516642859204#c3440534109745026509
# Counterions are potassium
# Results from https://github.com/NMRLipids/MATCH/blob/master/Data/Lipid_Bilayers/POPS%2B83%25popc/T298K/MODEL_CHARMM_GUI/OrdPars.dat are currently commented out

#
# It should be noted that pure POPC are ran with Gromacs 4, but the results with
# PS are ran with Gromacs 5. This has significant effect on acyl chains:

# The effect for headgroups can be estimated by comparing these two data sets:

#
# It might be good to run pure POPC at T298K with Gromacs 5 for the comparison.
