Quadrupolar splittings in kHz (y-axis)
concentrations (x-axis) in Moles

From publication:
all salt concentration dependence measurements 
contain 100mM=0.1M NaCl salt
except the dependence of NaCl itself 
(zero-point is 0M NaCl -- only counterions?)

values in dat files obtained through visual assignment 
from the figures in publication roux1990 
[Biochemistry, vol. 29, no. 30, 1990, Roux and Bloom]
using the programme g3data
